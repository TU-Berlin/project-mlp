[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight), in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]], as well as in calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''Photometria''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003-2004 mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo]]
The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e.&amp;nbsp;g.,
.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;)

The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt;. In contrast, if all the ice on earth were to melt - a so-called aquaplanet - the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless solar system bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometres, and ''H'' is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
===Illumination===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater.  The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between 3 and 12 degrees north.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99(11) |pages=818–827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the north and south hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Since forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo. Through the [[evapotranspiration]] of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy. This water vapour rises resulting in [[cloud cover]] which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests.

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland - Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-01-24 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=1991-05-30 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change [[cloud]] properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic mean''', or simply the '''mean''' or '''average''' when the context is clear, is the [[central tendency]] of a collection of numbers taken as the sum of the numbers divided by the size of the collection. The collection is often the [[sample space]] of an [[Experiment (probability theory)|experiment]]. The term &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; is preferred in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s such as the [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean]].

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[history]], though it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita GDP]] gives an approximation of the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s. Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of &quot;middle&quot;, and robust statistics such as the [[median]] may be a better description of central tendency.

==Definition==

Suppose we have sample space &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined via the equation
:&lt;math&gt;A:=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If the list is a [[statistical population]], then the mean of that population is called a '''population mean'''. If the list is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]], we call the resulting [[statistic]] a '''sample mean'''.

The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &quot;x bar&quot;) would be the mean of some [[sample space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last =Medhi | first =Jyotiprasad   | title =Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text
  | publisher =New Age International | year =1992 | pages =53-58  | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC&amp;dq  | id =ISBN 9788122404197  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivating properties==

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:

*If numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; have mean X, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1-X) + \ldots + (x_n-X) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x_i-X&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the residuals defined this way sum to zero.
*If it is required to use a single number ''X'' as an estimate for the value of numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squares (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''X'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]. (It follows that the mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt;
*For a [[normal distribution]], the arithmetic mean is equal to both the median and the mode, other measures of central tendency.

==Problems==
[[Image:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[mean]], [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]

The arithmetic mean may be misinterpreted as the median to imply that most values are higher or lower than is actually the case. If elements in the sample space [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the sample space {1,2,3,4}. The average is 2.5, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample space that cannot be arranged into an arithmetic progression, such as {1,2,4,8,16}, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. When one looks at the arithmetic average of a sample space, one must note that the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample space.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s in the United States median income has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income. Researchers dealing with frequency data must also be careful when reporting summary statistics such as means or median. Where a phenomenon is rare in general (for example, emergency room visits among the general population), but occurs frequently in some people (for example, dare devils), then the mean value may be much lower than the median.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt;

==Angles==
{{Main|Directional statistics}}

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or [[angle]]s. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:
*Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to a factor of [[Degree (angle)|360°]] (or 2π, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1° and &amp;minus;1°, or 1° and 719° – each of which gives a different average.
*Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).

In general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[statistics]], '''analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s, and their associated procedures, in which the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are all equal, and therefore generalizes [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups. Doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a [[type I error]]. For this reason, ANOVAs are useful in comparing two, three, or more means.

==Background and terminology==
ANOVA is a particular form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A statistical hypothesis test is a method of making decisions using data.  A test  result (calculated from the [[null hypothesis]] and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.  A statistically significant result (when a probability (p-value) is less than a threshold (significance level)) justifies the rejection of the [[null hypothesis]].

In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all
groups are simply random samples of the same population.  This implies
that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none).  Rejecting 
the null hypothesis implies that different treatments result in 
altered effects.  By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate 
of Type I errors (false positives leading to false scientific claims) 
to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit Type II 
errors (false negatives resulting in missed scientific discoveries).  
The Type II error rate is a function of several things including 
sample size (positively correlated with experiment cost), significance 
level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking 
a discovery are also high) and effect size (when the effect is 
obvious to the casual observer, Type II error rates are low).

The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical 
[[design of experiments]].  The experimenter adjusts factors and 
measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  Factors are 
assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and 
blocking to ensure the validity of the results.  Blinding keeps the
weighing impartial.  Responses show a variability that is partially 
the result of the effect and is partially random error. 

ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple 
purposes.  As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.
&quot;Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:
# As exploratory data analysis, an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).
# Comparisons of mean squares, along with F-tests ... allow testing of a nested sequence of models.
# Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, p 2)&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data. 

Additionally:
#&lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt; It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations to its assumptions.
# ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.
# It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.

As a result:
ANOVA &quot;has long enjoyed the status of being the '''most used''' (some would 
say abused) statistical technique in psychological research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Howell (2002, p 320)&lt;/ref&gt;
ANOVA &quot;is probably the '''most useful''' technique in the field of 
statistical inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, p 63)&lt;/ref&gt;

ANOVA is notoriously difficult to teach, particularly for complex 
experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases the proper 
application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition 
followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative text.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, p 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

; Analysis of variance (ANOVA): A mathematical process for separating the variability of a group of observations into assignable causes and setting up various significance tests.
; Balanced design: An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
; Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
; Design: A set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects.

; Effect: How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.
; Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error. 
; Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied.
; Factors: Process inputs an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output.
; Fixed effect: An effect associated with an input variable that has a limited number of levels or in which only a limited number of levels are of interest to the experimenter.
; Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.
; Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors. 
; Random effect: An effect associated with input variables chosen at random from a population having a large or infinite number of possible values. 
; Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Random error is also called experimental error.
; Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.
; Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.
; Responses: The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).
; Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.
; Variance components: Partitioning of the overall variation into assignable components.

==Models==
There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.

===Fixed-effects models (Model 1)===
{{Main|Fixed effects model}}
The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.

===Random-effects models (Model 2)===
{{Main|Random effects model}}
Random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variables]], some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Chapter 12: Experiments with random factors)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed-effects models (Model 3)===
{{Main|Mixed model}}
A mixed-effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.

Example:
Teaching experiments could be performed by a university department 
to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a 
treatment.  The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate 
texts.  The random-effects model would determine whether important 
differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.  The 
mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to 
randomly selected alternatives.  

Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing 
definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, pp 20–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions of ANOVA==
The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Even when the [[statistical model]] is [[nonlinear regression|nonlinear]], it can be approximated by a linear model for which an analysis of variance may be appropriate.

===Textbook analysis using a normal distribution===
The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Statistical Methods
| last1 = Snedecor | first1 = George W. 
| last2 = Cochran | first2 = William G.
| year = 1967 | edition = 6th | page = 321
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 48)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; Howell (2002, p 323)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = David R.
| last2 = Sweeney | first2 = Dennis J.
| last3 = Williams | first3 = Thomas A.
| title = Statistics for business and economics 
| publisher = West Pub. Co | location = Minneapolis/St. Paul 
| year = 1996 | edition = 6th| isbn = 0314063781 | pages = 452–453}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Statistical independence|Independence]] of observations &amp;ndash; this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
* [[normal distribution|Normality]] &amp;ndash; the distributions of the residuals are [[Normal distribution|normal]].
* Equality (or &quot;homogeneity&quot;) of variances, called [[homoscedasticity]] &amp;mdash; the variance of data in groups should be the same.

The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'s) are independent and

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Randomization-based analysis===
{{See also|Random assignment|Randomization test}}
In a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled experiment]], the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Unit-treatment additivity====
In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity states that the observed response &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; from experimental unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; when receiving treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the sum of the unit's response &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the treatment-effect &lt;math&gt; t_j&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;ref&gt;Kempthorne (1979, p 30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapters 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j.&lt;/math&gt;
The assumption of unit-treatment addivity implies that, for every treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th treatment have  exactly the same effect &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on every experiment unit.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].

====Derived linear model====
Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.

The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies by Kempthorne and his students&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;. However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Comparison of Treatments)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008, Chapter 1.14)&lt;/ref&gt; In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!

The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time.  Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.

====Statistical models for observational data====
However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or observational studies, model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization.&lt;ref&gt;
Kempthorne (1979, pp 125–126, 
&quot;The experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he 
feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled 
experimentally.  Those causes that he does not control experimentally, 
because he is not cognizant of them, he must control by the device of 
randomization.&quot;  &quot;[O]nly when the treatments in the experiment are 
applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is 
the chain of inductive inference sound.  It is ''only'' under these 
circumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he 
observes to the treatment and the treatment only.  Under these 
circumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense.&quot;)  
&lt;/ref&gt; For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, &quot;statistical models&quot; and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman {{full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
The textbook ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality and 
homogeneity of the variances of the residuals, while the 
randomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the 
variances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatment 
additivity).  Homoscedasticity seems the most general requirement for 
''comparing means'' via ANOVA.  However, studies of processes that 
change variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have 
been successfully conducted using ANOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are
''no'' necessary assumptions for ANOVA is its full generality, but the
F-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical 
limitations which are of continuing interest.

Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions. 
The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a &quot;change of scale&quot;, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7 or 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.

==Logic of ANOVA==
===Partitioning of the sum of squares===
{{main|Partition of sums of squares}}
The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] ''SS'' into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.

:&lt;math&gt;SS_\text{Total} = SS_\text{Error} + SS_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] ''DF'' can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a [[chi-squared distribution]] which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for &quot;treatments&quot; if there is no treatment effect.

:&lt;math&gt;DF_\text{Total} = DF_\text{Error} + DF_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].

===The F-test===
{{Main|F-test}}
The [[F-test]] is used for comparisons of the components of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\text{variance between treatments}}{\text{variance within treatments}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{MS_\text{Treatments}}{MS_\text{Error}} = {{SS_\text{Treatments} / (I-1)} \over {SS_\text{Error} / (n_T-I)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where  ''MS'' is mean square, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  = number of treatments and 
&lt;math&gt;n_T&lt;/math&gt; = total number of cases 

to the [[F-distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;I - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_T - I&lt;/math&gt;  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-squared distribution]].

The expected value of F is &lt;math&gt;1 + {n \sigma^2_\text{Treatment}} / 
{\sigma^2_\text{Error}}&lt;/math&gt; (where n is the treatment sample size)
which is 1 for no treatment effect.  As values of F increase above 1
the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis.  
Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the
sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental 
controls.

The textbook method of concluding the hypothesis test is to compare
the observed value of F with the critical value of F determined from
tables.  The critical value of F is a function of the numerator 
degrees of freedom, the denominator degrees of freedom and the 
significance level (α).  If F ≥ F&lt;sub&gt;Critical&lt;/sub&gt; (Numerator DF, Denominator DF, α)
then reject the null hypothesis.

The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value of 
F greater than or equal to the observed value.  The null hypothesis is 
rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance 
level (α).  The two methods produce the same result.

The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of 
minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive 
errors (maximizing power for a fixed significance level).  To test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s p-values: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum (2002, page 40) cites Section 5.7 (Permutation Tests), Theorem 2.3 (actually Theorem 3, page 184) of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, page 763) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The F-test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation.  It 
is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two 
''different'' samples have the same variance.  It is recommended for 
ANOVA where two estimates of the variance of the ''same'' 
sample are compared.  While the F-test is not generally robust against 
departures from normality, it has been found to be robust in the 
special case of ANOVA.  Citations from Moore &amp; McCabe (2003): 
&quot;Analysis of variance uses F statistics, but these are not 
the same as the F statistic for comparing two population standard 
deviations.&quot; (page 554) &quot;The F test and other procedures for inference 
about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in 
practice.&quot; (page 556)  &quot;[The ANOVA F test] is relatively insensitive 
to moderate nonnormality and unequal variances, especially when the 
sample sizes are similar.&quot; (page 763)  ANOVA assumes homoscedasticity, 
but it is robust.  The statistical test for homoscedasticity (the 
F-test) is not robust.  Moore &amp; McCabe recommend a rule of thumb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended logic===
ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance 
and hypothesis testing can be used individually.  ANOVA is used to 
support other statistical tools.  Regression is first used to fit more 
complex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the 
objective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the 
data.  &quot;Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but 
ANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models, 
and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  
&quot;[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring 
multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool 
for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worked numeric examples==
Several fully worked numerical examples are available.  A 
[[F-test#One-way_ANOVA_example|simple case]] uses one-way (a single 
factor) analysis.  A [[Two-way analysis of variance|more complex case]] 
uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.

==Associated analysis==
Some analysis is required in support of the ''design'' of the 
experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the 
factors are formally found to produce statistically significant 
changes in the responses.  Because experimentation is iterative, the 
results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.

===Preparatory analysis===
====Estimating sample size====
A variety of primitive methods are used to estimate the required 
group sample size.  These include graphical methods based on limiting
the probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on
an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based 
on achieving a desired confident interval.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 
3-7: Determining sample size)&lt;/ref&gt;  More elaborate methods are based on 
power analysis which relies on effect size.

Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology.
&quot;Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample 
size decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 596)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis, which
is available before the experiment is conducted, is informative in 
grant applications and administrative review boards.

====Power analysis====
[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 8: Power)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 11.12: Power (in ANOVA))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 13.7: Power analysis for factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, pp 778–780)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect size====
{{Main|Effect size}}
Several standardized measures of effect gauge the strength of the association between a predictor (or set of predictors) and the dependent variable. Effect-size estimates facilitate the comparison of findings in studies and across disciplines.  A non-standardized measure of effect size with meaningful units may 
be preferred for reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' ( ''eta-squared'' ):
Eta-squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors. Eta-squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population (it estimates only the effect size in the sample). On average it overestimates the variance explained in the population. As the sample size gets larger the amount of bias gets smaller,
: &lt;math&gt; \eta ^2 = \frac{SS_\text{Treatment}}{SS_\text{Total}} .&lt;/math&gt;

Cohen (1992) suggests effect sizes for various indexes, including ƒ (where 0.1 is a small effect, 0.25 is a medium effect and 0.4 is a large effect). He also offers a conversion table (see Cohen, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;283) for eta squared (η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) where 0.0099 constitutes a small effect, 0.0588 a medium effect and 0.1379 a large effect.

===Followup analysis===
====Model confirmation====
It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met.
Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity 
and gross normality.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-4: Model adequacy 
checking)&lt;/ref&gt;  One rule of thumb: &quot;If the largest standard deviation 
is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods 
based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results 
will still be approximately correct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, p 755,  
Qualifications to this rule appear in a footnote.)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
====Follow-up tests====
A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses.
Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.

Post hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors.
Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.

Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been 
criticized on several grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations 
regarding their use are vague or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 12: Multiple comparisons among treatment means)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5: Practical interpretation of results)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study designs and ANOVAs==
There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]],&lt;ref&gt; Cochran &amp; Cox (1957, p 9,
&quot;[T]he general rule [is] that the way in which the experiment is 
conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made, but also 
the calculations required to make them.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:
*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop. Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite doi|10.1093/biomet/6.1.1|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there are only two means to compare, the [[t-test]] and the ANOVA [[F-test]] are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and ''t'' is given by ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*[[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.
*[[Repeated measures]] ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a [[longitudinal study]]).
*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one [[dependent variable|response variable]].

==ANOVA cautions==
Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each 
treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced 
experiments offer more complexity.  For single factor (one way) ANOVA, 
the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced 
analysis lacks both robustness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, 
Section 3-3.4: Unbalanced data)&lt;/ref&gt;  For more complex designs the
lack of balance leads to further complications. &quot;The orthogonality 
property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data 
does not carry over to the unbalanced case.  This 
means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.  
Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more 
difficult than that for balanced designs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, 
Section 14-2: Unbalanced data in factorial design)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 
general case, &quot;The analysis of variance can also be applied to 
unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and 
F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation 
are considered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest techniques for 
handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data 
or by synthesizing missing data.  More complex techniques use 
regression. 

ANOVA is (in part) a significance test.  The American Psychological
Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is 
insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson 
(1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;

While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) 
against [[multiple comparisons]] in one dimension, it is not conservative 
against comparisons in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 600)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
ANOVA is considered to be a special case of linear regression&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, p 1) (with qualification in the later text)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; Montgomery (2001, Section 3.9: The Regression Approach to the Analysis of Variance)
&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is a special case of the [[general linear model]].&lt;ref&gt;
Howell (2002, p 604)&lt;/ref&gt;
All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a 
residual (error) to be minimized.

The [[Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test]] and the [[Friedman test]] are [[nonparametric]] tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 18: Resampling and nonparametric approaches to data)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-10: Nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century,
antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.&lt;ref&gt;
Stigler (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of 
squares, experimental techniques and the additive model.  [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] was
performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 134)&lt;/ref&gt;  
The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] circa 
1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the 
existing practices of astronomy and geodesy).  It also initiated much 
study of the contributions to sums of squares.  Laplace soon knew how 
to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of 
squares.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 153)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1827 Laplace was using least 
squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of 
atmospheric tides.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp 154-155)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting 
from reaction times (the &quot;[[personal equation]]&quot;) and had developed 
methods of reducing the errors.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp 240-242)&lt;/ref&gt;  The 
experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were 
later accepted by the emerging field of psychology &lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, 
Chapter 7 - Psychophysics as a Counterpoint)&lt;/ref&gt; which developed strong 
(full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and 
blinding were soon added.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 253)&lt;/ref&gt;  An eloquent 
non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was
available in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp 314-315)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Ronald Fisher proposed a formal analysis of [[variance]] in a 1918 article ''[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance''. Ronald A. Fisher. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh''. 1918. (volume 52, pages 399–433)&lt;/ref&gt;  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;On the &quot;Probable Error&quot; of a Coefficient of Correlation Deduced from a Small Sample. Ronald A. Fisher. Metron, 1: 3-32 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.

One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was 
computational elegance.  The structure of the additive model allows 
solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than 
by matrix calculations.  In the era of mechanical calculators this 
simplicity was critical.  The determination of statistical 
significance also required access to tables of the F function which 
were supplied by early statistics texts.

{{Acids and bases}}
[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|[[Zinc]], a typical metal, reacting with [[hydrochloric acid]], a typical acid]]
An '''acid''' (from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/acēre'' meaning ''sour''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a substance which reacts with a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. Commonly, acids can be identified as tasting sour, reacting with metals such as [[calcium]], and bases like [[sodium carbonate]]. Aqueous acids have a [[pH]] under 7, with acidity increasing the lower the pH. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.

Common examples of acids include [[acetic acid]] (in [[vinegar]]), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[tartaric acid]] (used in baking). As these three examples show, acids can be [[solutions]], [[liquids]], or [[solids]]. Gases such as [[hydrogen chloride]] can be acids as well. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].

There are three common definitions for acids: the Arrhenius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the Lewis definition. The Arrhenius definition states that acids are substances which increase the concentration of [[hydronium]] ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in solution. The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor. Most acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, and these two definitions are most relevant. The reason why pHs of acids are less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7. By the Brønsted-Lowry definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.

In chemistry, the Lewis definition of acidity is frequently encountered. Lewis acids are electron-pair acceptors. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal [[ion|cations]], and electron-deficient molecules such as [[boron trifluoride]] and [[aluminium trichloride]]. Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids as mentioned above, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

==Definitions and concepts==
{{main|Acid–base reaction}}
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.

===Arrhenius acids===
The Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydrogen]] in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that increases the concentration of the [[hydronium ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, when dissolved in water. This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and [[hydroxide ion|hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot;&gt;Ebbing, D.D., &amp; Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-618-51177-6&lt;/ref&gt;
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
In pure water the majority of molecules exist as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but a small number of molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating. Pure water is neutral with respect to acidity or basicity because the concentration of hydroxide ions is always equal to the concentration of hydronium ions. An Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]] is a molecule which increases the concentration of the hydroxide ion when dissolved in water. Note that chemists often write H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; .

===Brønsted-Lowry acids===
While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Brønsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives [[vinegar]] its characteristic taste:
:[[File:Acid-base.png]]
Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe [[molecule|molecular compounds]], whereas Arrhenius acids must be [[ion|ionic compounds]]. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:
# H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
# HCl(''benzene'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''benzene'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
# HCl(''g'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combine to form the solid.

===Lewis acids===
A third concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. All [[Brønsted acid]]s are also [[Lewis acid]]s, but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids. Contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]
In the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride &quot;loses&quot; a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[oxidizing agents|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]].

The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from an acid to a base.

==Dissociation and equilibrium==
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, where HA represents the acid and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ([[protonation]] and [[deprotonation]], respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] means ''the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[\mbox{H}^+] [\mbox{A}^-]}{[\mbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;
The stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is more frequently used, where p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;°C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

==Nomenclature==
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form [[hydrochloric acid]]. In the [[IUPAC]] naming system, &quot;aqueous&quot; is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix &quot;hydro-&quot; is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.

Classical naming system:

==Acid strength==
{{main|Acid strength}}

The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and one mole of the conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Stronger acids have a larger ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and a more negative p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids.

Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.

[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] &quot;salts&quot;. They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.

==Chemical characteristics==
===Monoprotic acids===
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):

:::::HA(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

Common examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH).
{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}

===Polyprotic acids===
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).

A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength. The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;). Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .

A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, then HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, and finally PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion. Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.

Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''α'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A, HA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and A&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_2 A}={{[H^+]^2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[H_2 A]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{HA^- }={{[H^+]K_1} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[HA^-]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{A^{2-}}={{K_1 K_2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[A^{2-} ]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \over { \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^n \Big[ [H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \Big] }

&lt;/math&gt;
where K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.

===Neutralization===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]
[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water:

::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) + NaCl(aq)

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.

Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].

===Weak acid–weak base equilibrium===
{{main|Henderson–Hasselbalch equation}}
In order to lose a proton, it is necessary that the pH of the system rise above the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the protonated acid. The decreased concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form, or to protonate its conjugate base (the deprotonated form).

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

==Applications of acids==
There are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].

Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.

In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with [[alcohol]]s, to produce [[ester]]s.

Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. Acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.
Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.

[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.

[[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin required in our body and is present in such foods as amla, lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.

Certain acids are used as drugs. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.

Acids play very important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in our stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of our body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA, RNA and transmission of characters to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.

===Acid catalysis===
{{Main|Acid catalysis}}
Acids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] and [[condensation reaction]]s. In biochemistry, many [[enzyme]]s employ acid catalysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet acid cat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G.; Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=496–500 |isbn=978-0-471-19350-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological occurrence==
[[Image:Aminoacid.png|thumb|left|Basic structure of an [[amino acid]].]]Many biologically important molecules are acids. [[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].

An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or ''alpha'' carbon) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some [[bacteria]]l [[cell wall]]s contains some &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the basic amine group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gains a proton (-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.

Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] &quot;head&quot; groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.

In humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].

Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]], releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and resupplying the cells with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium [[atomic clock]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;atomic-clocks&quot;/&gt; of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate representation of time known as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.usgs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nist-second&quot;/&gt; A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits very efficient light.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp2&quot;/&gt; [[Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity.

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; and ununennium has not yet been discovered; thus, the presentation of their properties here is limited. All the alkali metals are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;krebs&quot; /&gt; Because of this, they are usually stored in [[mineral oil]] or [[kerosene]] (paraffin oil).&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot;/&gt;

====Anomalous behaviour of lightest and heaviest alkali metals====
The chemistry of lithium is anomalous as the small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation polarises [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

The chemistry of ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to be closer to that of potassium&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; or rubidium&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]] would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the energetic properties{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; It may also show the +3 [[oxidation state]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} which is not seen in any other alkali metal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}} in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which may not be true due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;/&gt;

All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an [[aqueous solution]] of the strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] alkali metal [[hydroxide]] and releasing hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with [[effervescence]], but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalibangs&quot;/&gt;

The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with water is:

:2 M (s) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 MOH (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) (where M represents an alkali metal)&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;/&gt;

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sodium nitride]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=Jansen1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D., Jansen, M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|page=1755|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10&lt;1755::AID-ANIE1755&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jansen2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D.; Cancarevic, Z.; Schön, J.

[[File:Cs11O3 cluster.png|thumb|right|{{chem|Cs|11|O|3}} cluster|alt= The ball-and-stick diagram shows three regular octahedra which are connected to the next one by one surface and the last one shares one surface with the first. All three have one edge in common. All eleven vertices are purple spheres representing caesium, and at the center of each octahedron is a small red sphere representing oxygen.]]
All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;

The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with oxygen that forms the oxide is:
:4 M (s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (s) (where M represents an alkali metal)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;
The chemical reaction that forms the peroxide is:
:2 M (s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s) (where M represents an alkali metal)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;
The chemical reaction that forms the superoxide is:

The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s, forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. This includes [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from [[fluorine]] to [[iodine]]. All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; All the alkali metal halides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water except for [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), which has a very high [[lattice enthalpy]] because the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions are very small and strong [[electrostatic interaction]]s occur between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

The chemical reaction of the alkali metals with the halogens is:
:2 M + X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 MX (where M represents an alkali metal and X represents a halogen)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;

====Radioactivity====

All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring [[radioisotope]]: [[sodium-22]] and [[sodium-24]] are [[trace radioisotope]]s, [[potassium-40]] and [[rubidium-87]] have very long [[half-life|half-lives]] and thus occur naturally, and all [[isotopes of francium]] are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt1926&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr60009a003 | title = The Radioactivity of the Alkali Metals | year = 1926 | last1 = Patton | first1 = I.

The natural radioisotope of potassium, [[potassium-40]], makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/potassium.pdf |title=Potassium-40 |date=August 2005 |work=Human Health Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]], Environmental Science Division |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. The Soviet scientist [[D. K. Dobroserdov]] observed this weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium in 1925 and incorrectly assumed that [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-caesium (currently known to be francium) was contaminating the sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;fontani&quot; /&gt; He then claimed to have discovered eka-caesium and predicted its properties, naming it ''russium'' after his home country.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderkrogt-Fr&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Van der Krogt| first = Peter| title = Francium| work = Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict| date = 10 January 2006| url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Fr| accessdate =8 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.&lt;ref name=&quot;fontani&quot; /&gt;

===Periodic trends===

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other [[group (periodic table)|group]] are to each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; For instance, when moving down the table, all alkali metals show increasing [[atomic radius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; decreasing [[electronegativity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/properties.html |title=Atomic and Physical Properties of the Group 1 Elements |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; and decreasing melting and boiling points.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot; /&gt; In general, their [[density|densities]] increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot; /&gt;

The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; Because of the [[shielding effect]], when an atom has more than one [[electron shell]], each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.&lt;ref name=shielding&gt;{{cite book|first=Theodore|last=L. Brown|coauthors=H. Eugene LeMay, Jr., Bruce E. Bursten, Julia R. Burdge|year=2003|title=Chemistry: The Central Science|edition=8th|publisher=Pearson Education|location=US|isbn=0-13-061142-5|url=http://www.pearsoneducation.net/brown}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the alkali metals, the [[valence electron|outermost electron]] only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the [[nuclear charge]] (which is equal to the [[atomic number]]) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt;
{{clear}}
The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

The first ionization energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; (This trend is broken in francium due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].)&lt;!--Also explain why the alkali metals have the lowest ionization energies in their period.--&gt;

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled [[electron shell]] and is thus difficult to remove.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

====Reactivity====
{{main|Reactivity (chemistry)}}
The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;/&gt;

Electronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the  tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt;

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, [[lithium iodide]] ([[lithium|Li]][[iodine|I]]) will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, a property of most covalent compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; [[Lithium fluoride]] (Li[[fluorine|F]]) is the only [[alkali halide]] that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] (Li[[hydroxide|OH]]) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&amp;nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure [[actinium]]-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], [[radium]], [[lead]], [[bismuth]], or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemeducator&quot;&gt;Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B.

The next element below francium ([[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-francium) is likely to be [[ununennium]] (Uue), element 119,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} although this is not certain due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;/&gt; The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of [[einsteinium]]-254 with [[calcium]]-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California.

The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water.

'''Ambiguity''' of information, in words, pictures, or other media, is the ability to express more than one interpretation.  It is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]], in that specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately apparent), whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity. 

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

== Linguistic forms ==
The [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. &quot;Meaning&quot; hereby refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word &quot;bank&quot; has several distinct lexical definitions, including &quot;[[Bank|financial institution]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]&quot;. Another example is as in &quot;[[apothecary]]&quot;. One could say &quot;I bought herbs from the apothecary&quot;. This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says &quot;I buried $100 in the bank&quot;, most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word. For example, &quot;biweekly&quot; can mean &quot;fortnightly&quot; (once every two weeks – 26 times a year), or &quot;twice a week&quot; (104 times a year). If &quot;biweekly&quot; is used in a conversation about a meeting schedule, it may be difficult to infer which meaning was intended.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose &quot;[[weasel word]]s&quot; and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. &quot;Good&quot;, for example, can mean &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; (''That's a good hammer''), &quot;exemplary&quot; (''She's a good student''), &quot;pleasing&quot; (''This is good soup''), &quot;moral (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), &quot;[[righteous]]&quot;, etc. &quot; I have a good daughter&quot; is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity (&quot;unlockable&quot; can mean &quot;capable of being unlocked&quot; or &quot;impossible to lock&quot;).

[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a phrase can be [[parsing|parsed]] in more than one way. Such phrases can be assigned different interpretations because different grammatical structures can be assigned to the same string of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kroeger|first=Paul|title=Analysing Grammar: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-01653-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He ate the cookies on the couch&quot;, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.

[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words, for example &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;I scream&quot;. Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].

[[Meaning (linguistic)|Semantic ambiguity]] arises when a word or concept has an inherently diffuse meaning based on widespread or informal usage. This is often the case, for example, with idiomatic expressions whose definitions are rarely or never well-defined, and are presented in the context of a larger argument that invites a conclusion.

For example, &quot;You could do with a new automobile. How about a test drive?&quot; The clause &quot;You could do with&quot; presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].

Linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law (see [[Ambiguity (law)]]), because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

==Intentional application==
[[Philosopher]]s (and other users of [[logic]]) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say &quot;I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth&quot;, an example of a [[glittering generality]]. Some will think he opposes taxes in general, because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after &quot;taxes&quot; (to convey the first sense) or by changing &quot;which&quot; to &quot;that&quot; (to convey the second sense), or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each [[Electoral district|constituent]] will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true - An opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one, if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of [[amphiboly]] and [[equivocation]] rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[Continental philosophy]] (particularly [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]]), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the [[subject-object problem|subject and object]] is ambiguous, as is the relation of [[mind and body]], and [[mereology|part and whole]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. &quot;[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]&quot;. Poetry, Language, Thought. Trans. Albert Hofstadter. NY: Harper Collins, 1971, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Heidegger's phenomenology, [[Dasein]] is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of ''care'' and [[existential anxiety]], e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work [[Being and Nothingness]] an &quot;essay in phenomenological ontology&quot; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings ([[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: &quot;as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued thre same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone. ''The Ethics of Ambiguity.'' Trans. Bernard Frechtman. New York: Citadel Press, 1976 [1948], pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: &quot;Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us therefore try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, ''Ethics,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, An Introduction (Vol. 1). Trans Robert Hurley. New York: Vintage Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not in fact separate.&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Corey. ''Sources of Significance: Worldly Rejuvenation and Neo-Stoic Heroism.'' West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2010, pg. 35-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Ernest Becker]], he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous [[ideologies]] and historical events such as [[genocide]]. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Corey. &quot;Authoritative Disambiguation&quot;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxNR3aOL8l4]. Professoranton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]] and [[rhetoric]], ambiguity can be a useful tool. [[Groucho Marx]]'s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its [[humor]], for example: &quot;Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know&quot;. Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title &quot;Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; (where &quot;blue&quot; can refer to the color, or to [[sadness]]).

In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

All [[religions]] debate the [[orthodoxy]] or [[heterodoxy]] of ambiguity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] employ the concept of [[paradox]] synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Ambiguity within Christianity&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/9018.htm Living With Ambiguity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (and other religions) is resisted by the conservatives and fundamentalists, who regard the concept as equating with 'contradiction'. Non-fundamentalist Christians and Jews endorse [[Rudolf Otto]]'s description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.{{Dubious|date=July 2012|reason=Entire paragraph of doubtful validity}}.

[[Metonymy]] involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or [[jargon]], for the name of the whole object (for example &quot;wheels&quot; to refer to a car, or &quot;flowers&quot; to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern [[vocabulary]] critical [[semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/sim8.html CSI: Sim8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual [[contiguity]] (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as &quot;sweet ride&quot; to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.&lt;ref&gt;Veale, Tony (2003): &quot;Metaphor and Metonymy: The Cognitive Trump-Cards of Linguistic Humor&quot;[http://afflatus.ucd.ie/Papers/iclc2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology and management===
In sociology and social psychology, the term &quot;ambiguity&quot; is used to indicate situations that involve [[uncertainty]]. An increasing amount of research is concentrating on how people react and respond to ambiguous situations. Much of this focuses on [[ambiguity tolerance]]. A number of correlations have been found between an individual's reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factors.

Apter and Desselles (2001)&lt;ref&gt;in Motivational Styles in Everyday life: A guide to reversal Theory. M.J. Apter (ed) (2001) APA Books&lt;/ref&gt; for example, found a strong correlation with such attributes and factors like a greater preference for safe as opposed to risk-based sports, a preference for endurance-type activities as opposed to explosive activities, a more organized and less casual lifestyle, greater care and precision in descriptions, a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant words, a less acute sense of humor, engaging a smaller variety of sexual practices than their more risk-comfortable colleagues, a lower likelihood of the use of drugs, pornography and drink, a greater likelihood of displaying obsessional behavior.

In the field of [[leadership]], [[David Wilkinson (ambiguity expert)|David Wilkinson]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, D.J. (2006) ''The Ambiguity Advantage: What great leaders are great at''. New York Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; found strong correlations between an individual leader's reaction to ambiguous situations and the [[Modes of Leadership]] they use, the type of [[creativity]], Kirton (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kirton, M.J. (2003)Adaption-Innovation: In the Context of Diversity and Change. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and how they relate to others.

==Music==
In [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&amp;nbsp;195), &quot;Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.&quot;

== Visual art ==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image|thumb]]
In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].
The opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

==Constructed language==
Some [[Conlang|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created with this in mind, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

==Mathematical notation==
[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.

===Names of functions===
The '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument and/or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:
* [[Sinc function]]
* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List_of_notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
* [[Exponential integral]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot;&gt;M.Abramovits, I.Stegun. Handbook on mathematical functions&lt;/ref&gt; page 228 http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm
* [[Hermite polynomial]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot; /&gt; page 775 http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_775.htm

===Expressions===
Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if one sees &lt;math&gt;f=f(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, there is no way to distinguish whether it means &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; '''multiplied''' by &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, or function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; '''evaluated''' at argument equal to &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The language [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, &lt;math&gt;a/bc&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;a/(bc)&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.
In the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression
&lt;math&gt; s i n \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
means
product of variables
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, although in a slideshow, it may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt;, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
The writing of &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n,k}&lt;/math&gt; may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in &lt;math&gt;F_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Some scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:
Practically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
&quot;Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,&quot;
the reader may think. To avoid such ambiguitty, [[citations]] in Wikipedia appear inside square bracket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.
!--&gt;

===Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, which could be understood to mean either &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha/2))^2\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^2/2\,&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin(\sin(x))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\exp^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(x))&lt;/math&gt; (see [[tetration]]).

&lt;math&gt;~\sin^{−1} \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which by convention means &lt;math&gt;~\arcsin(\alpha) ~&lt;/math&gt;, though it might be thought to mean &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{−1}\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;~\sin^{n} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a/2b\,&lt;/math&gt;, which arguably should mean &lt;math&gt;(a/2)b\,&lt;/math&gt; but would commonly be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;a/(2b)\,&lt;/math&gt; .

===Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics===
It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with &lt;math&gt;~|\alpha\rangle~ &lt;/math&gt; and states with fixed number of photons with &lt;math&gt;~|n\rangle~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an &quot;unwritten rule&quot;: the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt;photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if &lt;math&gt;~|x\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and &lt;math&gt;~|p\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easy lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression &lt;math&gt; |1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

===Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics===
Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: &quot;... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly confusing term is ''[[gain]]''. For example, the sentence &quot;the gain of a system should be doubled&quot;, without context, means close to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.

The [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as &quot;definable&quot; or &quot;nameable&quot;. Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell/Whitehead, Principia Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity==
[[File:Necker cube and impossible cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]] and [[impossible cube]], an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively.|thumb]]
In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an ''underdetermined system'' (of equations or logic) – for example, &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; leaves open what the value of ''X'' is – while its opposite is a [[self-contradiction]], also called [[inconsistency]], [[paradoxicalness]], or [[oxymoron]], in an [[overdetermined system]] – such as &lt;math&gt;X=2, X=3&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution – see also [[underdetermination]].

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and [[impossible object]]s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Pedagogic use of ambiguous expressions==
Ambiguity can be used as a pedagogical trick, to force students to reproduce the deduction by themselves. Some textbooks&lt;ref&gt;
H. Haug, S. Koch. ''Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors'', http://www.allbookstores.com/book/9812387560&lt;/ref&gt;
give the same name to the function and to its [[Fourier transform]]:
:&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;.
Rigorously speaking, such an expression requires that &lt;math&gt;~ f=0 ~&lt;/math&gt;;
even if function &lt;math&gt;~ f ~&lt;/math&gt; is a [[self-Fourier function]], the expression should be written as
&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;; however, '''it is assumed that
the shape of the function ''' (and even its norm
&lt;math&gt;\int |f(x)|^2 {\rm d}x &lt;/math&gt;) '''depend on the character used to denote its argument'''.
If the Greek letter is used, it is assumed to be a Fourier transform of another function,
The first function is assumed, if the expression in the argument contains more characters &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~\tau~&lt;/math&gt;, than characters &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt;, and the second function is assumed in the opposite case. Expressions like &lt;math&gt;~f(\omega t)~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~f(y)~&lt;/math&gt; contain symbols &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt; in equal amounts; they are ambiguous and should be avoided in serious deduction.

The '''ampere''' (SI unit symbol: A), often [[Clipping (morphology)|shortened]] to '''amp''',&lt;ref name=BIPM2006&gt;SI supports only the use of symbols and deprecates the use of abbreviations for units.{{cite web | format = [[PDF]] | url= http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=2006  |page=130 | accessdate =2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[electric current]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BIPMdefinition&quot;&gt;{{Citation | chapter = 2.1.

It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of electrodynamics.

In practical terms, the ampere is a measure of the amount of [[electric charge]] passing a point in an electric circuit per unit time with 6.241&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[electron]]s, or one [[coulomb]] per second constituting one ampere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0‐307‐33598‐2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical definition may lead to confusion with the definition of a coulomb (i.e., 1 amp-second), but in practical terms this means that measures of a constant current (e.g., the nominal flow of charge per second through a simple circuit) will be defined in amperes (e.g., &quot;a 20 mA circuit&quot;) and the flow of charge through a circuit over a period of time will be defined in coulombs (e.g., &quot;a variable-current circuit that flows a total of 10 coulombs over 5 seconds&quot;). In this way, amperes can be viewed as a flow rate, i.e. number of particles (charged) transiting per unit time, and coulombs simply as the number of particles.

:&lt;math&gt;\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s&lt;/math&gt;
That is, in general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as ''Q'' = ''It''.

== History ==
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]] electromagnetic unit of current (now known as the [[abampere]]), the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML | title = A short history of the SI units in electricity | publisher = Montclair | last = Kowalski | first = L}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[International System of Units|MKSA system]] would be conveniently sized.

The &quot;international ampere&quot; was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118000}} grams of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm | title = History of the ampere | publisher = Sizes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is 0.99985&amp;nbsp;A.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's Law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.&lt;ref name = &quot;Electrical quantities&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html | title = SI brochure | chapter = Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities | publisher = BIPM}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.&lt;ref name= &quot;Electrical quantities&quot; /&gt;

== Proposed future definition ==
{{Main|New SI definitions}}
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed to define the ampere in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.&lt;ref name = &quot;Beyond&quot; /&gt;  Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val |6.2415093|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s (such as [[electron]]s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second, or the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charges in coulombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed change would define 1 A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] is expected to be formally proposed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

== Everyday examples ==
{{main|Orders of magnitude (current)}}
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]s) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable gadgets ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&amp;nbsp;mW at 1.4&amp;nbsp;V): 0.7&amp;nbsp;mA

=== Motor vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12&amp;nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&amp;nbsp;W): 166&amp;nbsp;mA.
*Headlights (typically 60&amp;nbsp;W): 5&amp;nbsp;A each.
*Starter Motor (typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;kW): 80-160&amp;nbsp;A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most United States, Canada and Mexico domestic power suppliers run at 120&amp;nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;A or 20&amp;nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 290&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 500–830&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&amp;nbsp;kW): 16.6&amp;nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&amp;nbsp;kW): 38.3&amp;nbsp;A

=== European domestic supply – 230 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&amp;nbsp;V, so the current drawn by a particular European appliance (in Europe) will be less than for an equivalent American one (in the United States).&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The formula for power is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
so it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter Portable Television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 150&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 250–450&amp;nbsp;mA
*Compact Fluorescent Lamp (13–30&amp;nbsp;W): 58–112&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&amp;nbsp;kW): 9&amp;nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&amp;nbsp;kW): 20&amp;nbsp;A

In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]] equivalent to the statement that &quot;''the [[cartesian product#Infinite products|product]] of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty''&quot;. More explicitly, it is stating that for every indexed [[Family of sets|family]] &lt;math&gt;(S_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; of [[nonempty]] sets there exists an indexed family &lt;math&gt;(x_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; of elements such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \in S_i&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;.  The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in order to formalize his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zermelo, 1904&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526 |format=reprint|title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16|doi=10.1007/BF01445300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one object in each bin. For example for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can be obtained only by invoking the axiom of choice.

Although originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;Jech, 1977, p. 348''ff''; Martin-Löf 2008, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is included in [[ZFC]], the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]]. One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as [[Tychonoff's theorem]], require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the [[axiom of determinacy]]. The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.

==Statement==
A [[choice function]] is a function ''f'', defined on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets, such that for every set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.  With this concept, the axiom can be stated:
:For any set ''X'' of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function ''f'' defined on ''X''.
Thus the negation of the axiom of choice states that there exists a set of nonempty sets which has no choice function.

Each choice function on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets is an element of the [[Cartesian product#Infinite products|Cartesian product]] of the sets in ''X''. This is not the most general situation of a Cartesian product of a [[indexed family|family]] of sets, where a same set can occur more than once as a factor; however, one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor, and such elements correspond to an element of the Cartesian product of all ''distinct'' sets in the family. The axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements; it is therefore equivalent to:

:Given any family of nonempty sets, their Cartesian product is a nonempty set.

=== Nomenclature ZF, AC, and ZFC ===
In this article and other discussions of the '''Axiom of Choice''' the following abbreviations are common:
*AC &amp;ndash; the Axiom of Choice.
*ZF &amp;ndash; [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] omitting the Axiom of Choice.
*ZFC &amp;ndash; [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], extended to include the Axiom of Choice.

===Variants===
There are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice. These are equivalent in the sense that, in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it. 

One variation avoids the use of choice functions by, in effect, replacing each choice function with its range.
:Given any set ''X'' of [[pairwise disjoint]] non-empty sets, there exists at least one set ''C'' that contains exactly one element in common with each of the sets in ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Herrlich, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
This guarantees for any [[partition of a set|partition]] of a set ''X'' the existence of a subset ''C'' of ''X'' containing exactly one element from each part of the partition.

Another equivalent axiom only considers collections ''X'' that are essentially powersets of other sets:
:For any set A, the [[power set]] of A (with the empty set removed) has a choice function.
Authors who use this formulation often speak of the ''choice function on A'', but be advised that this is a slightly different notion of choice function.  Its domain is the powerset of ''A'' (with the empty set removed), and so makes sense for any set ''A'', whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article, the domain of a choice function on a ''collection of sets'' is that collection, and so only makes sense for sets of sets.  With this alternate notion of choice function, the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as
:Every set has a choice function.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Suppes]], &quot;Axiomatic Set Theory&quot;, Dover, 1972 (1960), ISBN 0-486-61630-4, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;
which is equivalent to
:For any  set A there is a function ''f'' such that for any non-empty subset B of ''A'', ''f''(''B'') lies in ''B''.
The negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as:
:There is a set ''A'' such that for all functions ''f'' (on the set of non-empty subsets of ''A''), there is a ''B'' such that ''f''(''B'') does not lie in ''B''.

=== Restriction to finite sets ===
The statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every [[finite set|finite collection]] of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF); it is easily proved by [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourlakis (2003), pp. 209–210, 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the even simpler case of a collection of ''one'' set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.

==Usage==
Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until [[Zermelo]].

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice. For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]] to prove &quot;for every natural number ''k'', every family of ''k'' nonempty sets has a choice function.&quot;) This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the [[axiom of countable choice]]. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i''∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, but there is no stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no &quot;limiting&quot; choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.

==Examples==
The nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection ''X'' is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  Next we might try specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So this attempt also fails.

Additionally, consider for instance the unit circle S, and the action on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples of π. Here G is countable while S is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits under G. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint from X. In other words, the circle gets partitioned into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Now it is easy to convince oneself that the set X could not possibly be measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S. Hence one couldn't expect to find an algorithm to find a point in each orbit, without using the axiom of choice. See [[non-measurable set#Example|non-measurable set]] for more details.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering.  One might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.

==Criticism and acceptance==

A proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly [[definable set|defining]] the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a [[well-ordering]] of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] can be proven to exist using the axiom of choice, it is [[consistent]] that no such set is definable. 

The axiom of choice produces these intangibles (objects that are proven to exist, but which cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles. Because there is no [[Canonical form|canonical]] well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in [[category theory]]).  This has been used as an argument against the use of the axiom of choice. 

Another argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of counterintuitive objects. One example is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which says that it is possible to decompose (&quot;carve up&quot;) the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are [[non-measurable set]]s.

Despite these facts, most mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.

It is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF), regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The restriction to ZF renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation unprovable. For example, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Similarly, all the statements listed below which require choice or some weaker version thereof for their proof are unprovable in ZF, but since each is provable in ZF plus the axiom of choice, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.  Statements such as the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as conditional statements, for example, &quot;If AC holds, the decomposition in the Banach–Tarski paradox exists.&quot; Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.

== In constructive mathematics ==

As discussed above, in ZFC, the axiom of choice is able to provide &quot;[[nonconstructive proof]]s&quot; in which the existence of an object is proved although no explicit example is constructed. ZFC, however, is still formalized in classical logic. The axiom of choice has also been thoroughly studied in the context of constructive mathematics, where non-classical logic is employed.  The status of the axiom of choice varies between different varieties of constructive mathematics. 

In [[Martin-Löf type theory]] and higher-order [[Heyting arithmetic]], the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is (depending on approach) included as an axiom or provable as a theorem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Martin-Löf]], ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/crary/819-f09/Martin-Lof80.pd Intuitionistic type theory]'', 1980. 
[[Anne Sjerp Troelstra]], ''Metamathematical investigation of intuitionistic arithmetic and analysis'', Springer, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Errett Bishop]] argued that the axiom of choice was constructively acceptable, saying
:&quot;A choice function exists in constructive mathematics, because a choice is implied by the very meaning of existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Errett Bishop]] and [[Douglas S. Bridges]], ''Constructive analysis'', Springer-Verlag, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[constructive set theory]], however, [[Diaconescu's theorem]] shows that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle (unlike in Martin-Löf type theory, where it does not). Thus the axiom of choice is not generally available in constructive set theory. A cause for this difference is that the axiom of choice in type theory does not have the [[extensionality]] properties that the axiom of choice in constructive set theory does.&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Martin-Löf]], &quot;100 Years of Zermelo’s Axiom of Choice: What was the Problem with It?&quot;, ''The Computer Journal'' (2006) 49 (3): 345-350. doi: 10.1093/comjnl/bxh162 &lt;/ref&gt;

Some results in constructive set theory use the [[axiom of countable choice]] or the [[axiom of dependent choice]], which do not imply the law of the excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.&lt;ref&gt; Fred Richman, “Constructive mathematics without choice”, in: Reuniting the Antipodes—Constructive and Nonstandard Views of the Continuum (P. Schuster et al., eds), Synthèse Library 306, 199–205, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==

Assuming ZF is consistent, [[Kurt Gödel]] showed that the ''negation'' of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an [[inner model]] (the [[constructible universe]]) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] employed the technique of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], developed for this purpose, to show that the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logically independent]] of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use of the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems which are provable using choice are of an elegant general character: every ideal in a ring is contained in a maximal ideal, every vector space has a basis, and every product of compact spaces is compact. Without the axiom of choice, these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinality.

The proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]], are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC.&lt;ref&gt;This is because arithmetical statements are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] to the [[constructible universe]] ''L''. [[Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem]] gives a more general result.&lt;/ref&gt; Statements in this class include the statement that [[P = NP]], the [[Riemann hypothesis]], and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

==Stronger axioms==
The [[axiom of constructibility]] and the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] both imply the axiom of choice, but are strictly stronger than it.

In class theories such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], there is a possible axiom called the [[axiom of global choice]] which is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes. And the axiom of global choice follows from the [[axiom of limitation of size]].

==Equivalents==
There are important statements that, assuming the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]].  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.

*[[Set theory]]
**[[Well-ordering theorem]]: Every set can be well-ordered. Consequently, every [[cardinal number|cardinal]] has an [[initial ordinal]].
**[[Tarski's theorem]]: For every infinite set ''A'', there is a [[bijective map]] between the sets  ''A'' and ''A''×''A''.
**[[Trichotomy (mathematics)|Trichotomy]]: If two sets are given, then either they have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other.
**The [[Cartesian product#Infinite products|Cartesian product]] of any family of nonempty sets is nonempty.
**[[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]]: Colloquially, the sum of a sequence of cardinals is strictly less than the product of a sequence of larger cardinals. (The reason for the term &quot;colloquially&quot;, is that the sum or product of a &quot;sequence&quot; of cardinals cannot be defined without some aspect of the axiom of choice.)
**Every [[surjective function]] has a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]].

*[[Order theory]]
**[[Zorn's lemma]]: Every non-empty partially ordered set in which every chain (i.e. totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.
**[[Hausdorff maximal principle]]: In any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. The restricted principle &quot;Every partially ordered set has a maximal totally ordered subset&quot; is also equivalent to AC over ZF.
**[[Tukey's lemma]]: Every non-empty collection of [[finite character]] has a maximal element with respect to inclusion.
**[[Antichain]] principle: Every partially ordered set has a maximal [[antichain]].

*[[Abstract algebra]]
**Every [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=Andreas|title=Existence of bases implies the axiom of choice|journal=Contemporary mathematics|year=1984|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] other than the trivial ring contains a [[maximal ideal]].
**For every non-empty set ''S'' there is a [[binary operation]] defined on ''S'' that makes it a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;[[András Hajnal|A. Hajnal]], A. Kertész: Some new algebraic equivalents of the axiom  of choice, ''Publ. Math. Debrecen'', '''19'''(1972),  339&amp;ndash;340, see also H. Rubin, J. Rubin, ''Equivalents of the axiom of choice, II'', [[North-Holland Publishing Company|North-Holland]], 1985, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; (A [[cancellation property|cancellative]] binary operation is enough.)

*[[Functional analysis]]
**The closed unit ball of the dual of a [[normed vector space]] over the reals has an [[extreme point]].

*[[General topology]]
**[[Tychonoff's theorem]] stating that every [[product topology|product]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[topological space]]s is compact.
**In the product topology, the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a product of subsets is equal to the product of the closures.

*[[Mathematical logic]]
**If ''S'' is a set of sentences of [[first-order logic]] and ''B'' is a consistent subset of ''S'', then ''B'' is included in a set that is maximal among consistent subsets of ''S''.  The special case where ''S'' is the set of '''all''' first-order sentences in a given [[signature (logic)|signature]] is weaker, equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]]; see the section &quot;Weaker forms&quot; below.

=== Category theory ===
There are several results in [[category theory]] which invoke the axiom of choice for their proof.  These results might be weaker than, equivalent to, or stronger than the axiom of choice, depending on the strength of the technical foundations.  For example, if one defines categories in terms of sets, that is, as sets of objects and morphisms (usually called a [[small category]]), or even locally small categories, whose hom-objects are sets, then there is no [[category of sets|category of all sets]], and so it is difficult for a category-theoretic formulation to apply to all sets.  On the other hand, other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger, and an identical category-theoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation, à la class theory, mentioned above.

Examples of category-theoretic statements which require choice include:
*Every small [[category (mathematics)|category]] has a [[skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]].
*If two small categories are weakly equivalent, then they are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].
*Every continuous functor on a small-complete category which satisfies the appropriate solution set condition has a [[adjoint functors|left-adjoint]] (the Freyd adjoint functor theorem).

==Weaker forms==
There are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but are closely related. One example is the [[axiom of dependent choice]] (DC). A still weaker example is the [[axiom of countable choice]] (AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; or CC), which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets. These axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary [[mathematical analysis]], and are consistent with some principles, such as the Lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals, that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice.

Other choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].  The former is equivalent in ZF to the existence of an [[ultrafilter]] containing each given filter, proved by Tarski in 1930.

===Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) but weaker than it===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Basis (linear algebra)]] --&gt;
One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

*[[Set theory]]
**Any [[union (set theory)|union]] of countably many [[countable sets]] is itself countable.
**If the set ''A'' is [[infinite set|infinite]], then there exists an [[injective function|injection]] from the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to ''A'' (see [[Dedekind infinite]]).
**Every infinite [[determinacy#Basic notions|game]] &lt;math&gt;G_S&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Borel set|Borel]] subset of [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] is [[determinacy#Basic notions|determined]].

*[[Measure theory]]
**The [[Vitali set|Vitali theorem]] on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s which states that there is a subset of the [[real numbers]] that is not [[Lebesgue measurable]].
**The [[Hausdorff paradox]].
**The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].
**The [[Lebesgue measure]] of a countable [[disjoint union]] of measurable sets is equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.

*[[Algebra]]
**Every [[field (mathematics)|field]] has an [[algebraic closure]].
**Every [[field extension]] has a [[transcendence basis]].
**[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]] needs the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]].
**The [[Nielsen–Schreier theorem]], that every subgroup of a free group is free.
**The additive groups of '''[[real numbers|R]]''' and '''[[complex numbers|C]]''' are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-February/009959.html&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=4931240&amp;aid=4931232&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Functional analysis]]
**The [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] in [[functional analysis]], allowing the extension of [[linear map|linear functionals]]
**The theorem that every [[Hilbert space]] has an orthonormal basis.
**The [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]] about [[compactness]] of sets of functionals.
**The [[Baire category theorem]] about [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]s, and its consequences, such as the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]] and the [[closed graph theorem]].
**On every infinite-dimensional topological vector space there is a [[discontinuous linear map]].

*[[General topology]]
**A uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
**Every [[Tychonoff space]] has a [[Stone–Čech compactification]].

*[[Mathematical logic]]
**[[Gödel's completeness theorem]] for first-order logic: every consistent set of first-order sentences has a completion. That is, every consistent set of first-order sentences can be extended to a maximal consistent set.

==Stronger forms of the negation of AC==
Now, consider stronger forms of the negation of AC.  For example, if we abbreviate by BP the claim that every set of real numbers has the [[property of Baire]], then BP is stronger than ¬AC, which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets.  Note that strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of AC.  For example, ZF + DC&lt;ref&gt;[[Axiom of dependent choice]]&lt;/ref&gt; + BP is consistent, if ZF is.

It is also consistent with ZF + DC that every set of reals is [[Lebesgue measurable]]; however, this consistency result, due to [[Robert M. Solovay]], cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild [[large cardinal]] assumption (the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]]). The much stronger [[axiom of determinacy]], or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the [[perfect set property]] (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many [[Woodin cardinal]]s).

==Statements consistent with the negation of AC==
There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬C.  For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a function ''f'' from the real numbers to the real numbers such that ''f'' is not continuous at ''a'', but ''f'' is [[Sequential continuity|sequentially continuous]] at ''a'', i.e., for any sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converging to ''a'', lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; f(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=f(a).
*There exists a model of ZF¬C which has an infinite set of real numbers without a countably infinite subset.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets.&lt;ref&gt;Jech, Thomas (1973) &quot;The axiom of choice&quot;, ISBN 0-444-10484-4, CH. 10, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a field with no algebraic closure.
*In all models of ZF¬C there is a vector space with no basis.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a free [[complete boolean algebra]] on countably many generators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavi, 1974&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first= Jonathan | last=Stavi| year=1974| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/d5710380t753621u/ |format=reprint|title=A model of ZF with an infinite free complete Boolean algebra| journal=Israel Journal of Mathematics| volume=20| issue= 2| pages=149–163|doi=10.1007/BF02757883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For proofs, see [[Thomas Jech]], ''The Axiom of Choice'', American Elsevier Pub. Co., New York, 1973.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which every set in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[measurable]].  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the [[Axiom of dependent choice]], which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of [[real analysis]].
*In all models of ZF¬C, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

==Quotes==
&quot;The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the [[Well-ordering theorem|well-ordering principle]] obviously false, and who can tell about [[Zorn's lemma]]?&quot; —&amp;nbsp;[[Jerry Bona]]
:This is a joke: although the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition.

&quot;The Axiom of Choice is necessary to select a set from an infinite number of socks, but not an infinite number of shoes.&quot; —&amp;nbsp;[[Bertrand Russell]]
:The observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes by stating for example, to choose the left shoe.  Without the axiom of choice, one cannot assert that such a function exists for pairs of socks, because left and right socks are (presumably) indistinguishable from each other.

&quot;Tarski tried to publish his theorem [the equivalence between AC and 'every infinite set ''A'' has the same cardinality as ''A''x''A''', see above] in [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]], but [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] refused to present it. Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known [true] propositions is not a new result, and Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest&quot;.
:Polish-American mathematician [[Jan Mycielski]] relates this anecdote in a 2006 article in the Notices of the AMS.

{{Infobox actinium}}
'''Actinium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|i|ə|m}} {{respell|ak|TIN|nee-əm}}) is a radioactive [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ac''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;89, which was discovered in 1899. It was the first [[Primordial element|non-primordial radioactive element]] to be isolated. [[Polonium]], [[radium]] and [[radon]] were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. Actinium gave the name to the [[actinide]] series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and [[lawrencium]] in the [[periodic table]].

A soft, silvery-white [[radioactive]] metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As most [[lanthanide]]s and actinides, actinium assumes [[oxidation state]] +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] ores as the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, which decays with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting [[beta particle]]s. One [[tonne]] of [[uranium]] ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and [[lanthanum]] makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;{{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use.

[[André-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]] residues left by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] after they had extracted [[radium]]. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to [[titanium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-active |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 129 |pages = 593–595 |year = 1899 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3085b/f593.table |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in 1900) as similar to [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-actif – l'actinium |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 130 |pages = 906–908 |year = 1900–1901 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3086n/f906.table |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] independently discovered actinium in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Radium und radioactive Stoffe |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 35 |issue = 3 |pages = 3608–3611 |year = 1902 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190203503187 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a substance being similar to [[lanthanum]] and called it &quot;emanium&quot; in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber den Emanationskörper (Emanium) |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696–1699 |year = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur l'actinium |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 139 |pages = 538–540 |year = 1904 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Hariett Brooks]] in 1904, and [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Otto Sackur]] in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696–1699 |year = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 38 |issue = 1 |pages = 775–778 |year = 1905 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190503801130 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.

The name actinium originates from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''aktis, aktinos'' (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium, such as [[acetyl]], [[acetate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gilley, Cynthia Brooke |author2=University of California, San Diego.

The first element of the [[actinide]]s, actinium gave the group its name, much as [[lanthanum]] has done for the [[lanthanide]]s. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1945 that [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] proposed the most significant change to [[Mendeleev]]'s [[periodic table]], by introducing the actinides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Transuranium Elements |first = Glenn T. |last = Seaborg |journal = Science |volume = 104 |issue = 2704 |year = 1946 |pages = 379–386 |jstor=1675046 |doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379 |pmid = 17842184 |bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxides===
Actinium oxide (Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 °C or the [[oxalate]] at 1100 °C, in vacuum. It crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Halides===
Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding [[hydrofluoric acid]] to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 °C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 900–1000 °C yields [[oxyfluoride]] AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 °C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;&lt;ref name=m87&gt;Meyer, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

:AcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → AcOF + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F

Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or [[oxalate]] with [[carbon tetrachloride]] vapors at temperatures above 960 °C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium [[oxychloride]] can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 1000 °C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

Reaction of [[aluminium bromide]] and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide:
:Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 AcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 °C results in the oxybromide AcOBr.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Other compounds===
Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 °C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing [[monosodium phosphate]] (NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·0.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and heating actinium oxalate with [[hydrogen sulfide]] vapors at 1400 °C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 °C.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of actinium}}
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of one radioactive [[isotope]]; {{chem|227|Ac}}. Thirty-six [[radioisotope]]s have been identified, the most stable being {{chem|227|Ac}} with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, {{chem|225|Ac}} with a half-life of 10.0 days and {{chem|226|Ac}} with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than 1 minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is {{chem|217|Ac}} (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through [[alpha decay]] and [[electron capture]]. Actinium also has two [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Audi |first = Georges |title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties |journal = Nuclear Physics A |volume = 729 |pages = 3–128 |publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center |year = 2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purified {{chem|227|Ac}} comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days. It decays according to its 21.773-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.8%) and some alpha particles (1.2%);&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article008169.html Actinium], [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; the successive decay products are part of the [[actinium series]]. Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (46 keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, {{chem|227|Ac}} is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; The isotopes of actinium range in [[atomic weight]] from 206&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] ({{chem|206|Ac}}) to 236&amp;nbsp;u ({{chem|236|Ac}}).&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;/&gt;

==Occurrence and synthesis==
[[File:Uraninite-39029.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Uraninite]] ores have elevated concentrations of actinium.]]
Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] ores as &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac – one tonne of ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01158a033 |last1=Hagemann |year=1950 |first1=French |pages=768 |volume=72 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |title=The Isolation of Actinium |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g946&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actinium [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is a transient member of the [[Decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]] [[decay chain]], which begins with the parent isotope [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (or [[Plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]) and ends with the stable lead isotope [[Isotopes of lead|&lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. Another actinium isotope (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac) is transiently present in the [[Decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] [[decay chain]], beginning with [[Neptunium|&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np]] (or [[Uranium-233|&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U)]] and ending with [[thallium]] (&lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Tl) and near-stable [[bismuth]] (&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi).

The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01158a034 |last1=Fried |year=1950 |first1=Sherman |pages=771 |volume=72 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |last2=Hagemann |first2=French |last3=Zachariasen |first3=W.

The reaction yield is about 2% of the radium weight. &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-[[benzene]] solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the [[pH]] (to about 6.0 for actinium).&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate [[resin]] in [[nitric acid]], which can result in a separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as [[eluant]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was first produced artificially at the [[Institute for Transuranium Elements]] (ITU) in Germany using a [[cyclotron]] and at [[St George Hospital, Sydney|St George Hospital]] in Sydney using a [[Linear particle accelerator|linac]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.11.012 |year = 2009 |author = Melville, G; Allen, Bj |title = Cyclotron and linac production of Ac-225 |volume = 67 |issue = 4 |pages = 549–55 |pmid = 19135381 |journal = Applied radiation and isotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium-226 target with 20–30 MeV [[deuterium]] ions. This reaction also yields &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ac which however decays with a half-life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Pamela J.; Jackson, Paul and Kingsley, Elizabeth Anne [http://books.google.com/books?id=K1y6k5bdlWkC&amp;pg=PA336 Prostate cancer methods and protocols], Humana Press, 2003, ISBN 0-89603-978-1, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with [[lithium]] vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 °C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond, C. R. ''The Elements'' in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;!--http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4066566--&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft. The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac pressed with [[beryllium]] is also an efficient [[neutron source]] with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium-beryllium and radium-beryllium pairs.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Russell, Alan M. and Lee, Kok Loong [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA470 Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals], Wiley, 2005, ISBN 0-471-64952-X, pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt; In all those applications, &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (a beta source) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha-emitting isotopes upon its decay. Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;AcBe neutron sources can be applied in a [[neutron probe]] – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, D.

This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac itself, but also its decay products emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its decay products might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was bound to a [[Chelation|chelating]] agent, such as [[citrate]], [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA) or [[pentetic acid|diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid]] (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Improved in Vivo Stability of Actinium-225 Macrocyclic Complexes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to [[trastuzumab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] that interferes with the [[HER2/neu]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].

The medium half-life of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (21.77 years) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Its decay product, &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa decays to &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nozaki |first1=Yoshiyuki |title=Excess 227Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486 |year=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geibert |first1=W. |last2=Rutgers Van Der Loeff |first2=M.M. |last3=Hanfland |first3=C. |last4=Dauelsberg |first4=H.-J. |title=Actinium-227 as a deep-sea tracer: sources, distribution and applications |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=198 |pages=147 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00512-5 |bibcode=2002E&amp;PSL.198..147G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
&lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a glove box and radiation shielding. When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats, about 33% of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50% into the liver. Its toxicity is comparable, but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2172/4406766 |title = Toxicology of Actinium Equilibrium Mixture |first2 = J. |last = Langham |last2 = Storer |first = W. |year = 1952 | journal = Los Alamos Scientific Lab.: Technical Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Americium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|m|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|s|i|ə|m}} {{respell|AM|ə|RIS|ee-əm}}) is a [[transuranic element|transuranic]] [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] that has the symbol '''Am''' and [[atomic number]] 95. This [[transuranic element]] of the [[actinide]] series is located in the [[periodic table]] below the [[lanthanide]] element [[europium]], and thus by analogy was named after another continent, [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|year = 1946|pages = 379–386|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184|jstor = 1675046|bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Although it is the third element in the [[transuranic element|transuranic series]], it was discovered fourth, after the heavier [[curium]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by bombarding [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial [[ionization chamber]] [[smoke detectors]], as well as in [[neutron source]]s and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].

Americium is a relatively soft [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metal with silvery appearance. Its most common isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am. In chemical compounds, they usually assume the [[oxidation state]] +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified by their characteristic [[optical absorption]] spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contains intrinsic defects, which are [[metamictization|induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles]] and accumulate with time; this results in a drift of some material properties.

==History==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.]]
[[File:Americium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide), produced in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;LBL NEWS Magazine, Vol.6, No.3, Fall 1981, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. They used a 60-inch [[cyclotron]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Morgan/morgan.html Obituary of Dr. Leon Owen (Tom) Morgan (1919–2002)], Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) of the [[University of Chicago]]. Following the lighter [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], and heavier [[curium]], americium was the fourth [[transuranium element]] to be discovered. At the time, the [[periodic table]] had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the [[lanthanide]] one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after another continent, [[Americas|America]]: &quot;The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G.

The new element was isolated from its [[oxide]]s in a complex, multi-step process. First [[plutonium]]-239 nitrate (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;PuNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]], and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]]. Further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]], yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Robert E.

Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Am. [[Americium-241]] was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a [[alpha particle|α-particle]] to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np; the [[half-life]] of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=1997|page=1|volume=624|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf|bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second isotope &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Upon rapid [[Beta-decay|β-decay]], &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts into the isotope of curium &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (which had been discovered previously).

The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]]; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the [[Quiz Kids]], five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate =7 July 2010| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of americium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, Glenn T. {{US patent|3156523}} &quot;Element&quot;, Filing date: 23 August 1946, Issue date: 10 November 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity.

The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, all [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.

Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium;  due to military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.|last2=Studier|first2=M.|last3=Diamond|first3=H.|last4=Mech|first4=J.|last5=Inghram|first5=M.|last6=Pyle|first6=G.|last7=Stevens|first7=C.|last8=Fried|first8=S.|last9=Manning|first9=W.|title=Transplutonium Elements in Thermonuclear Test Debris|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|page=180|year=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.180|bibcode = 1956PhRv..102..180F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinitite]], the glassy residue left on the desert floor near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]], after the [[plutonium]]-based [[Trinity test|Trinity]] [[nuclear testing|nuclear bomb test]] on 16 July 1945, contains traces of americium-241. Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crash site]] of a US B-52 bomber, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eriksson, Mats|title=On Weapons Plutonium in the Arctic Environment|publisher=[[Lund University]]|date=April 2002|location=Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark|accessdate=15 November 2008|url=http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf|format=PDF|page=28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081218233551/http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other regions, the average radioactivity due to residual americium is only about 0.01&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|picocuries]] (0.37&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|mBq]]). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Americium], Los Alamos National Laboratory, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of various americium isotopes, mostly &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Klaus ''Kann man Gold machen?

The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as [[nuclear transmutation]], but it is still being developed for americium.&lt;ref&gt;Baetslé, L.

==Synthesis and extraction==

Americium has been produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s for decades, and kilograms of its &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotopes have been accumulated by now.&lt;ref name=g1262&gt;Greenwood, p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 [[United States dollar|USD]] per gram of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf57.html Smoke detectors and americium], World Nuclear Association, January 2009, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The heavier isotope &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100–160 USD/mg.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C. R. &quot;The elements&quot; in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emeléus, H. J. [http://books.google.com/books?id=K5_LSQqeZ_IC&amp;pg=PA2 Advances in inorganic chemistry], Academic Press, 1987, ISBN 0-12-023631-1 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The capture of two neutrons by &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {2(n,\gamma)} \ ^{241}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [14.35 \ yr]{\beta^-} \ ^{241}_{\ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;/&gt; However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu decays to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am after about 15 years, and the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bredl.org/sapc/Pu_ReportI.htm BREDL Southern Anti-Plutonium Campaign], Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The obtained &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a [[light water reactor]] (LWR), 79% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 10% to its [[nuclear isomer]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am:&lt;ref group=note&gt;The &quot;metastable&quot; state is marked by the letter m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.41.448|author=Sasahara, A.

:10%:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{241}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{242m}_{\ \ \ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Americium-242]] has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu captures four neutrons under high [[neutron flux]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4.956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Metal generation ===
Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium need to be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) is dissolved in [[nitric acid]], and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a [[PUREX]]-type extraction ('''P'''lutonium –'''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a [[hydrocarbon]]. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a [[diamide]]-based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatography|chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt; with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the [[solvent extraction]] of americium. For example, a recent [[European Union|EU]] funded project codenamed &quot;EUROPART&quot; studied [[triazine]]s and other compounds as potential extraction agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Dalton Trans.]]|year = 2003|pages = 1675–1685|doi = 10.1039/b301178j|title = The coordination chemistry of 1,2,4-triazinyl bipyridines with lanthanide(III) elements – implications for the partitioning of americium(III)|author = Hudson, M.

==Physical properties==
[[File:Closest packing ABAC.png|thumb|Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red).]]

In the [[periodic table]], americium is located right to plutonium, left to curium, and below the lanthanide [[europium]], with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, americium is lighter than both curium (13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); but is heavier than europium (5.264&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower [[bulk modulus]] than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu.&lt;ref name=pressure/&gt; Its melting point of 1173&amp;nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639&amp;nbsp;°C) and europium (826&amp;nbsp;°C), but lower than for curium (1340&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=W|title=Preparation and some properties of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=29|page=2577|year=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(67)80183-0|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt;

At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal symmetry]], and a [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc with lattice parameters ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 346.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and ''c''&amp;nbsp;= 1124&amp;nbsp;pm, and four atoms per [[unit cell]]. The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McWhan|first1=D.B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=B.B.|last3=Wallmann|first3=J.C.|title=Crystal structure, thermal expansion and melting point of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=24|page=1025|year=1962|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(62)80246-2|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and lattice constant ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 489&amp;nbsp;pm. This ''fcc'' structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt; Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa.&lt;ref name=pressure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U|title=Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=100|page=153|year=1984|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770&amp;nbsp;°C it changes into an ''fcc'' phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075&amp;nbsp;°C it converts to a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, [[praseodymium]] and [[neodymium]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, David A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=F2HVYh6wLBcC&amp;pg=PA226 Phase diagrams of the elements], University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0-520-07483-1 pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced [[Interstitial defect|lattice defects]] is relatively low, by broadening of [[X-ray diffraction]] peaks.

This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity.

Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in [[acid]]s. The most common [[oxidation state]] for americium is +3,&lt;ref name=p4&gt;Penneman, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], [[iodate]], [[hydroxide]], [[phosphate]] and other salts.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; (yellow), Am&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (brown) and Am&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5-&lt;/sup&gt; (dark green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie-master.de/FrameHandler.php?loc=http://www.chemie-master.de/pse/pse.php?modul=Am Americium], Das Periodensystem der Elemente für den Schulgebrauch (The periodic table of elements for schools) chemie-master.de (in German), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g1265&gt;Greenwood, p. 1265&lt;/ref&gt; All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amoh4/&gt;&lt;ref name=carbonate/&gt; For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811&amp;nbsp;nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715&amp;nbsp;nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=haxav/&gt;

Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the [[permanganate]] ion (MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) in acidic solutions.&lt;ref name = &quot;HOWI_1956&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as [[americium dioxide]] (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and americium(IV) fluoride (AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Chemical compounds==
===Oxygen compounds===
Two americium oxides are known, with the oxidation states +3 (Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and +4 (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Americium(III) oxide]] is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = &quot;HOWI_1972&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americium dioxide|Americium(IV) oxide]] is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic ([[fluorite]]) crystal structure.&lt;ref name=g1267&gt;Greenwood, p. 1267&lt;/ref&gt;

The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the chemical formula Am&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240&amp;nbsp;°C and starts decomposing into AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 300&amp;nbsp;°C, the decomposition completes at about 470&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25&amp;nbsp;g/L.&lt;ref name=p5&gt;Penneman, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
[[Halide]]s of americium are known for the oxidation states +2, +3 and +4,&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWI_1969&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1969&lt;/ref&gt; where the +3 is most stable, especially in solutions.&lt;ref name=hal1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

Reduction of Am(III) compounds with sodium [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] yields Am(II) salts – the black halides AmCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AmBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They are very sensitive to oxygen and oxidize in water, releasing hydrogen and converting back to the Am(III) state. Specific lattice constants are:

Americium(III) fluoride (AmF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is poorly soluble and precipitates upon reaction of Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and fluoride ions in weak acidic solutions:

The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which is similar to that of AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90&amp;nbsp;°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.&lt;ref name=amoh4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

Most americium(III) halides form hexagonal crystals with slight variation of the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to [[uranium(III) chloride]] (space group P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/m) and the melting point of 715&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWI_1969&quot;/&gt; The fluoride is isotypic to LaF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (space group P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc) and the iodide to BiI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (space group R{{overline|3}}).

Americium is an artificial element, and thus a biological function involving the element, like all elements heavier than [[tungsten]], would be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Toeniskoetter, Steve; Dommer, Jennifer and Dodge, Tony [http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/periodic/elements/am.html The Biochemical Periodic Tables – Americium], University of Minnesota, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=2439|author=Dodge, C.J.

==Fission==
The isotope &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am (half-life 141 years) has the largest cross sections for absorption of thermal neutrons (5,700 [[Barn (unit)|barns]]),&lt;ref name = &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;&gt;Pfennig, G.; Klewe-Nebenius, H and Seelmann Eggebert, W. (Eds.): Karlsruhe [[nuclide]], 7 Edition 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; that results in a small [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The critical mass for a bare &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am sphere is about 9–14&amp;nbsp;kg (the uncertainty results from insufficient knowledge of its material properties). It can be lowered to 3–5&amp;nbsp;kg with a metal reflector and should become even smaller with a water reflector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dias, H.; Tancock, N. and Clayton, A.|title=Critical Mass Calculations for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am|journal=Nippon Genshiryoku Kenkyujo JAERI|year=2003|pages=618–623|url=http://typhoon.jaea.go.jp/icnc2003/Proceeding/paper/6.5_022.pdf}} [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200403/000020040303A0828431.php Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Such small critical mass is favorable for portable [[nuclear weapon]]s, but those based on &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am are not known yet, probably because of its scarcity and high price. The critical masses of two other readily available isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, are relatively high – 57.6 to 75.6&amp;nbsp;kg for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 209&amp;nbsp;kg for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire, [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf &quot;Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety data and limits for actinides in transport&quot;], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Scarcity and high price yet hinder application of americium as a [[nuclear fuel]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ronen, Y.; Aboudy, M. and Regev, D.|title=A novel method for energy production using &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am as a nuclear fuel|journal=Nuclear technology |year=2000|volume=129|issue=3|pages=407–417|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1337515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are proposals of very compact 10-kW high-flux reactors using as little as 20&amp;nbsp;grams of &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Such low-power reactors would be relatively safe to use as [[neutron source]]s for [[Nuclear medicine|radiation therapy]] in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronen, Y.; Aboudy, M. and Regev, D.|title=Homogeneous &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am-Fueled Reactor for Neutron Capture Therapy|journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering|year=2001|volume=138|issue=3|pages=295–304|osti=20804726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{See also|Isotopes of americium}}
About 19 [[isotope]]s and 8 [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370&amp;nbsp;years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a long half-life of 141&amp;nbsp;years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64&amp;nbsp;microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;245m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am to 50.8&amp;nbsp;hours for &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.&lt;ref name = &quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-241]] decays to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486&amp;nbsp;MeV (85.2%) and 5.443&amp;nbsp;MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit [[gamma ray]]s with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://87.139.25.178:81/eng/theory.htm|title=α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Theory - A lecture course on radioactivity|author=Christian Klinck|publisher=University of Technology Kaiserslautern|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americium-242]] is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02&amp;nbsp;h.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt; It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, but also by [[electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (17.3%). Both &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu down to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.

Nearly all (99.541%) of &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays by [[internal conversion]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np. The latter breaks down to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and then to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-243]] transforms by α-emission into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, which converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, and the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu changes into &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by emitting an α-particle.

===Ionization detectors===
{{Main|Americium smoke detector}}

Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where one common type of [[smoke detector]] uses &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm Smoke Detectors and Americium], Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002. (Internet Archive), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope is preferred against &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[radium|Ra]] because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little of harmful γ-radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|microcurie]] (37&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|kBq]]) or 0.28 [[microgram]]. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into [[neptunium]]-237, a different [[transuranic element]] with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% [[neptunium]] after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an [[ionization chamber]], an air-filled space between two [[electrode]]s, and permits a small, constant [[Electric current|current]] between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to [[Type I and type II errors|false alarms]].&lt;ref&gt;Residential Smoke Alarm Performance, Thomas Cleary, Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, UL Smoke and Fire Dynamics Seminar.

===Radionuclide===
As &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a significantly longer half-life than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTG&quot;&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)&lt;/ref&gt; Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 6.31&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am&lt;ref name=res/&gt; (cf. 390&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu)&lt;ref name=&quot;RTG&quot;/&gt; – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the [[European Space Agency]] is planning to use americium for its space probes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/09rtg/ Space agencies tackle waning plutonium stockpiles], Spaceflight now, 9 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles.&lt;ref name=rocket&gt;{{cite news|title = Extremely Efficient Nuclear Fuel Could Take Man To Mars In Just Two Weeks|publisher = [[ScienceDaily]]|date = 3 January 2001|url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm|accessdate =22 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017120211/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm| archivedate= 17 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title = An americium-fueled gas core nuclear rocket|booktitle = AIP Conf.

''et al.''|doi = 10.1063/1.43073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fission products of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic generator]].&lt;ref name=mprice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronen|first1=Y|last2=Shwageraus|first2=E|title=Ultra-thin 242mAm fuel elements in nuclear reactors|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=455|page=442|year=2000|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(00)00506-4|issue=2|bibcode = 2000NIMPA.455..442R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining &quot;cathode&quot;. A single 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am charge of such battery could provide about 140&amp;nbsp;kW of power over a period of 80 days.&lt;ref&gt;Genuth, Iddo [http://thefutureofthings.com/articles.php?itemId=26/64/ Americium Power Source], The Future of Things, 3 October 2006, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With all the potential benefits, the current applications of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].&lt;ref name=mprice/&gt;

===Neutron source===
The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am pressed with [[beryllium]] is an efficient [[neutron source]]. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{241\!\,}_{\ 95}Am\ \longrightarrow \ ^{237}_{\ 93}Np\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The most widespread use of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;AmBe neutron sources a [[neutron probe]] – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in [[neutron radiography]], tomography and other radiochemical investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;/&gt;

===Production of other elements===
Americium is a starting material for the production of other [[transuranic element]]s and [[transactinide]]s – for example, 82.7% of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 17.3% to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. In the nuclear reactor, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which transforms by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;

Irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am by &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne ions yields the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Es ([[einsteinium]]) or &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Db ([[dubnium]]), respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;Harry H. Binder: ''Lexikon der chemischen Elemente'', S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, ISBN 3-7776-0736-3, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the element [[berkelium]] (&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, [[nobelium]] was produced at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for [[lawrencium]], discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt;

===Spectrometer===
Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in [[radiography]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed [[nuclear density gauge]]s and [[nuclear densometer]]s. For example, the element has been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt; Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/indx_dec.jsp Nuclear Data Viewer 2.4], NNDC&lt;/ref&gt; Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.

==Health issues==
As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=809&amp;tid=158 Public Health Statement for Americium] Section 1.5., Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, April 2004, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

If consumed, americium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, roughly 45% of it goes to the [[liver]] and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and [[trabecula]]r surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs23am241.pdf|author=Division of Environmental Health, Office of Radiation Protection|title=Fact Sheet # 23.

Americium often enters landfills from discarded [[smoke detector]]s. The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions.

{{Infobox atom}}
The '''atom''' is a basic unit of [[matter]] that consists of a dense central [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by a [[electron cloud|cloud]] of [[electric charge|negatively charged]] [[electrons]]. The [[atomic nucleus]] contains a mix of positively charged [[proton]]s and electrically neutral [[neutron]]s (except in the case of [[hydrogen-1]], which is the only stable [[nuclide]] with no neutrons). The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other, forming a [[molecule]]. An atom containing an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral, otherwise it has a positive charge if there are fewer electrons ([[electron deficiency]]) or negative charge if there are more electrons (electron excess). A positively or negatively charged atom is known as an [[ion]]. An atom is [[Periodic table|classified]] according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus: the [[atomic number|number of protons]] determines the [[chemical element]], and the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]] determines the [[isotope]] of the element.&lt;ref name=leigh1990/&gt;

The name atom comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:ἄτομος#Ancient Greek|ἄτομος]] (''atomos'', &quot;indivisible&quot;) from ''[[wikt:ἀ-#Ancient Greek|ἀ-]]'' (''a-'', &quot;not&quot;) and ''[[wikt:τέμνω#Ancient Greek|τέμνω]]'' (''temnō'', &quot;I cut&quot;),&lt;ref name=liddell_scott_to_cut/&gt; which means uncuttable, or indivisible, something that cannot be divided further.&lt;ref name=liddell_scott_uncuttable/&gt; The concept of an atom as an indivisible component of matter was first proposed by early [[Indian philosophy|India]]n and [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosophers. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[chemist]]s provided a physical basis for this idea by showing that certain substances could not be further broken down by chemical methods. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[physicist]]s discovered subatomic components and structure inside the atom, thereby demonstrating that the 'atom' was divisible. The principles of [[quantum mechanics]] were used to successfully [[Scientific modelling|model]] the atom.&lt;ref name=haubold_mathai1998/&gt;{{sfn|Harrison|2003|pp=123–139}}

Atoms are minuscule objects with proportionately tiny masses. Atoms can only be observed individually using special instruments such as the [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. Over 99.94% of an atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus,&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the case of hydrogen-1, with a single electron and nucleon, the proton is &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}\frac{1836}{1837} \approx 0.9995\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, or 99.95% of the total atomic mass. All other nuclides (isotopes of hydrogen and all other elements) have more nucleons than electrons, so the fraction of mass taken by the nucleus is closer to 100% for all of these types of atoms, than for hydrogen-1.&lt;/ref&gt; with protons and neutrons having roughly equal mass. Each element has at least one isotope with an unstable nucleus that can undergo [[radioactive decay]]. This can result in a [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] that changes the number of protons or neutrons in a nucleus.&lt;ref name=slac_20090615/&gt; Electrons that are bound to atoms possess a set of stable [[energy level]]s, or [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]], and can undergo transitions between them by absorbing or emitting [[photon]]s that match the energy differences between the levels. The electrons determine the chemical properties of an element, and strongly influence an atom's [[Magnetism|magnetic]] properties.

==History==
{{Main|Atomic theory}}

===Atomism===
{{Main|Atomism}}
The concept that matter is composed of [[wikt:discrete|discrete]] units and cannot be divided into arbitrarily tiny quantities has been around for [[millennia]], but these ideas were founded in abstract, philosophical reasoning rather than [[experiment]]ation and [[Empirical|empirical observation]]. The nature of atoms in philosophy varied considerably over time and between cultures and schools, and often had spiritual elements. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the atom was adopted by scientists thousands of years later because it elegantly explained new discoveries in the field of chemistry.{{sfn|Ponomarev|1993|pp=14–15}}

References to the concept of atoms date back to ancient [[History of Greece|Greece]] and [[History of India|India]]. In India, the [[Ājīvika]], [[Jain]], and [[Cārvāka]] schools of atomism may date back to the 6th century BCE.{{sfn|McEvilley|2002|p=317}} The [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools later developed theories on how atoms combined into more complex objects.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=105–107}} In the West, the references to atoms emerged in the 5th century BCE with [[Leucippus]], whose student, [[Democritus]], systematized his views. In approximately 450&amp;nbsp;BCE, Democritus coined the term ''átomos'' ({{lang-el|ἄτομος}}), which means &quot;uncuttable&quot; or &quot;the smallest indivisible particle of matter&quot;. Although the [[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian]] and [[Atomism#Greek atomism|Greek concepts]] of the atom were based purely on philosophy, modern science has retained the name coined by Democritus.{{sfn|Ponomarev|1993|pp=14–15}}

[[Corpuscularianism]] is the postulate, expounded
in the 13th-century by the [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Pseudo-Geber]] (Geber),{{sfn|Moran|2005|p=146}} sometimes identified with [[Paul of Taranto]], that all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles.{{sfn|Levere|2001|p=7}} Corpuscularianism is similar to the theory of atomism, except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure.&lt;ref name=pratt20070928/&gt; Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory over the next several hundred years.

In 1661, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Robert Boyle]] published ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' in which he argued that matter was composed of various combinations of different &quot;corpuscules&quot; or atoms, rather than the [[classical element]]s of air, earth, fire and water.{{sfn|Siegfried|2002|pp=42–55}} During the 1670s corpuscularianism was used by [[Isaac Newton]] in his development of the [[corpuscular theory of light]].{{sfn|Levere|2001|p=7}}&lt;ref name=kemerling20020808/&gt;

===Origin of scientific theory===
[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808), one of the earliest scientific works on atomic theory]]
Further progress in the understanding of atoms did not occur until the science of [[chemistry]] began to develop. In 1789, French nobleman and scientific researcher [[Antoine Lavoisier]] discovered the [[law of conservation of mass]] and defined an [[Chemical element|element]] as a basic substance that could not be further broken down by the methods of chemistry.&lt;ref name=lavoisier_eoc/&gt;

In 1805, English instructor and natural philosopher [[John Dalton]] used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small [[Natural number|whole number]]s (the [[law of multiple proportions]]) and why certain gases dissolved better in water than others. He proposed that each element consists of atoms of a single, unique type, and that these atoms can join together to form chemical compounds.{{sfn|Wurtz|1881|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Dalton|1808}} Dalton is considered the originator of modern [[atomic theory]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1895|pp=129}}

Dalton's atomic hypothesis did not specify the size of atoms. Common sense indicated they must be very small, but nobody knew how small. Therefore it was a major landmark when in 1865 [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] measured the size of the molecules that make up air.

An additional line of reasoning in support of particle theory (and by extension [[atomic theory]]) began in 1827 when [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] used a [[microscope]] to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically—a phenomenon that became known as &quot;[[Brownian motion]]&quot;. J. Desaulx suggested in 1877 that the phenomenon was caused by the thermal motion of water molecules, and in 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] produced the first mathematical analysis of the motion.&lt;ref name=adp322_8_549/&gt;{{sfn|Mazo|2002|pp=1–7}}&lt;ref name=lee_hoon1995/&gt; French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory.&lt;ref name=e31_2_50/&gt;

[[File:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.png|thumb|left|[[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev's]] first periodic table (1869)]]
In 1869, building upon earlier discoveries by such scientists as Lavoisier, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first functional [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=pte20071101/&gt; The table itself is a visual representation of the periodic law, which states that certain chemical properties of [[chemical element|element]]s repeat ''periodically'' when arranged by [[atomic number]].{{sfn|Scerri|2007|pp=10–17}}

===Subcomponents and quantum theory===
[[File:Atom diagram.png|thumb|right|A generic atomic planetary model, or the [[Rutherford model]]]]
The physicist [[J. J. Thomson]], through his work on [[cathode ray]]s in 1897, discovered the electron, and concluded that they were a component of every atom. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.&lt;ref name=nobel1096/&gt; Thomson postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom, possibly rotating in rings, with their charge balanced by the presence of a uniform sea of positive charge. This later became known as the [[plum pudding model]].

In 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], under the direction of physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]], bombarded a sheet of gold foil with [[alpha particle|alpha rays]]—by then known to be positively charged helium atoms—and discovered that a small percentage of these particles were deflected through much larger angles than was predicted using Thomson's proposal. Rutherford interpreted the [[gold foil experiment]] as suggesting that the positive charge of a heavy gold atom and most of its mass was concentrated in a nucleus at the center of the atom—the [[Rutherford model]].&lt;ref name=pm21_669/&gt;

While experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.&lt;ref name=npc1921/&gt; The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s.&lt;ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/&gt;

[[File:Bohr Model.svg|left|thumb|A [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, showing an electron jumping between fixed orbits and emitting a [[photon]] of energy with a specific frequency]]

Meanwhile, in 1913, physicist [[Niels Bohr]] suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states.&lt;ref name=stern20050516/&gt; An electron must absorb or emit specific amounts of energy to transition between these fixed orbits. When the [[light]] from a heated material was passed through a [[Prism (optics)|prism]], it produced a multi-colored [[spectrum]]. The appearance of fixed [[Spectral line|lines in this spectrum]] was successfully explained by these orbital transitions.&lt;ref name=bohr19221211/&gt;

Later in the same year [[Henry Moseley]] provided additional experimental evidence in favor of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]]. These results refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius Van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, [[atomic number]] was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.{{sfn|Pais|1986|pp=228–230}}

[[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were now explained, by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.&lt;ref name=jacs38_4_762/&gt; As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]],{{sfn|Scerri|2007|pp=205–226}} in 1919 the American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus.&lt;ref name=jacs41_6_868/&gt;

The [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.&lt;ref name=fop17_6_575/&gt;

In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves. In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional [[waveform]]s rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [[Point (geometry)|position]] and [[momentum]] of a particle at the same time; this became known as the [[uncertainty principle]], formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa. This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [[Spectral line|spectral]] patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.&lt;ref name=brown2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison2000/&gt;

[[File:Mass Spectrometer Schematic.svg|right|thumb|Schematic diagram of a simple mass spectrometer]]
The development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the exact mass of atoms to be measured. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]].&lt;ref name=pm39_6_449/&gt; The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], a neutral-charged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.&lt;ref name=chadwick1935/&gt;

===Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter===

In 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product.&lt;ref name=hahn_meitner_strassmann/&gt; A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.&lt;ref name=nature143_3615_239/&gt;&lt;ref name=schroeder/&gt; In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.&lt;ref name=pt50_9_26/&gt;

In the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.&lt;ref name=kullander2001/&gt; Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. The [[standard model of particle physics]] was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.&lt;ref name=npp1990/&gt;

==Components==
===Subatomic particles===
{{Main|Subatomic particle}}
Though the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [[subatomic particle]]s. The constituent particles of an atom are the [[electron]], the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]. However, the [[hydrogen|hydrogen-1]] atom has no neutrons and a positive [[hydrogen ion]] has no electrons.

The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at {{val|9.11|e=-31|u=kg}}, with a negative [[Electric charge|electrical charge]] and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.{{sfn|Demtröder|2002|pp=39–42}} Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}, although this can be reduced by changes to the [[binding energy|energy binding]] the proton into an atom. Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of electrons,{{sfn|Woan|2000|p=8}} or {{val|1.6929|e=-27|u=kg}}. Neutrons and protons have comparable dimensions—on the order of {{val|2.5|e=-15|u=m}}—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.{{sfn|MacGregor|1992|pp=33–37}}

In the [[Standard Model]] of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{frac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of −{{frac|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.&lt;ref name=pdg2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=schombert2006/&gt;

The quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction]] (or strong force), which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [[nuclear force]], which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of [[gauge boson|gauge]] [[boson]]s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical [[force]]s.&lt;ref name=pdg2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=schombert2006/&gt;

===Nucleus===
{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|350px|The [[binding energy]] needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus, for various isotopes]]&lt;!-- A brief explanation is provided here because 'binding energy' is not explained until the end of the setion. --&gt;

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [[atomic nucleus]], and are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1.07 \sqrt[3]{A} \text{ fm}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''A'' is the total number of nucleons.{{sfn|Jevremovic|2005|p=63}} This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the [[residual strong force]]. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the [[electrostatic force]] that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.{{sfn|Pfeffer|2000|pp=330–336}}

Atoms of the same [[chemical element|element]] have the same number of protons, called the [[atomic number]]. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [[nuclide]]. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [[radioactive decay]].&lt;ref name=wenner2007/&gt;

The neutron and the proton are different types of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect that prohibits ''identical'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum physical state at the same time. Thus every proton in the nucleus must occupy a different state, with its own energy level, and the same rule applies to all of the neutrons. This prohibition does not apply to a proton and neutron occupying the same quantum state.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

For atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with roughly matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which modifies this trend. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium); and as Z increases toward the heaviest nuclei, the ratio of neutrons per proton required for stability increases to about 1.5.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [[positron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—an [[antimatter]] electron—is emitted along with an electron [[neutrino]].]]

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the [[coulomb barrier]]—and
fuse together into a single nucleus.&lt;ref name=mihos2002/&gt; [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.&lt;ref name=lbnl20070330/&gt;&lt;ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/&gt;

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass loss and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This deficit is part of the [[binding energy]] of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.{{sfn|Shultis|Faw|2002|pp=10–17}}

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than [[iron]] and [[nickel]]—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.&lt;ref name=ajp63_7_653/&gt; It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in [[star]]s a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [[nucleon]] in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and [[atomic mass]]es higher than about 60, is an [[endothermic reaction|endothermic process]]. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of a star.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymond&quot;/&gt;

===Electron cloud===
{{Main|Atomic orbital|Electron configuration}}

[[File:Potential energy well.svg|right|thumb|A potential well, showing, according to [[classical mechanics]], the minimum energy ''V''(''x'') needed to reach each position ''x''. Classically, a particle with energy ''E'' is constrained to a range of positions between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave–particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.&lt;ref name=science157_3784_13/&gt; Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantize]]d) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt; Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and they differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.&lt;ref name=manthey2001/&gt;

[[File:S-p-Orbitals.svg|left|thumb|Wave functions of the first five atomic orbitals. The three 2p orbitals each display a single angular [[Node (physics)|node]] that has an orientation and a minimum at the center.]]

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [[energy level]] of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name=Brucat2008/&gt;

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the [[electron binding energy]]—is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]]. For example, it requires only 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV to strip a [[Stationary state|ground-state]] electron from a hydrogen atom,&lt;ref name=herter_8/&gt; compared to 2.23&amp;nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a [[deuterium]] nucleus.&lt;ref name=pr79_2_282/&gt; Atoms are [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ion]]s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s like [[Ionic crystal|ionic]] and [[Covalent bond|covalent]] network [[Crystallization|crystals]].{{sfn|Smirnov|2003|pp=249–272}}

==Properties==
===Nuclear properties===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides|List of elements by stability of isotopes}}

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of ''protons'' in their nuclei belong to the same [[chemical element]]. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of ''neutrons'' are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons ([[hydrogen-1]], by far the most common form,&lt;ref name=matis2000/&gt; also called protium), one neutron ([[deuterium]]), two neutrons ([[tritium]]) and [[isotopes of hydrogen|more than two neutrons]]. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element [[hydrogen]] up to the 118-proton element [[ununoctium]].&lt;ref name=weiss20061017/&gt; All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive.{{sfn|Sills|2003|pp=131–134}}&lt;ref name=dume20030423/&gt;

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=lidsay20000730/&gt; of which 255 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as &quot;[[stable isotope]]s&quot;. However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even [[list of nuclides|in theory]]. Another 165 (bringing the total to 255) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as &quot;stable&quot;. An additional 33 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the [[solar system]]. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as [[primordial nuclide]]s. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as [[radium]] from [[uranium]]), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).&lt;ref name=tuli2005/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For more recent updates see [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart Interactive Chart of Nuclides (Brookhaven National Laboratory)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- See article [[list of nuclides]]. The numbers are derived by [[WP:CALC]] (counting the table), which is not [[WP:OR]]--&gt;

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one [[stable isotope]] exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element [[tin]]. Elements [[technetium|43]], [[promethium|61]], and all elements numbered [[bismuth|83]] or higher have no stable isotopes.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;CRC Handbook (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain &quot;magic numbers&quot; of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 255 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons ''and'' odd number of neutrons: [[hydrogen-2]] ([[deuterium]]), [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]] and [[nitrogen-14]]. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd-odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: [[potassium-40]], [[vanadium-50]], [[lanthanum-138]] and [[tantalum-180m]]. Most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

===Mass===
{{Main|Atomic mass|mass number}}

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called &quot;nucleons&quot;) in a given atom is called the [[mass number]]. The mass number is a simple whole number, and has units of &quot;nucleons.&quot; An example of use of a mass number is &quot;carbon-12,&quot; which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).

The actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed using the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]] (u), which is also called a dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.&lt;ref name=iupac/&gt; [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]], the lightest isotope of hydrogen and the atom with the lowest mass, has an atomic weight of 1.007825&amp;nbsp;u.&lt;ref name=chieh2001/&gt; The value of this number is called the [[atomic mass]]. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the mass of the atomic mass unit. However, this number will not be an exact whole number except in the case of carbon-12 (see below)&lt;ref name=nist_wc/&gt; The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208,{{sfn|Sills|2003|pp=131–134}} with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=u}}.&lt;ref name=audi2003/&gt;

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&amp;nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12&amp;nbsp;u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;Mills ''et al.'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;!--the reference given is available online at http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf for anyone who wants to check whether this paragraph constitutes original research--&gt;

===Shape and size===
{{Main|Atomic radius}}
Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]]. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a [[chemical bond]]. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms ([[coordination number]]) and a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref name=aca32_5_751/&gt; On the [[periodic table]] of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).&lt;ref name=dong1998/&gt; Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]], while one of the largest is [[caesium]] at 225&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Zumdahl (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

When subjected to external fields, like an [[electrical field]], the shape of an atom may deviate from that of a sphere. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by [[group theory|group-theoretical]] considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in [[crystal]]s, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at [[crystal symmetry|low-symmetry]] lattice sites.&lt;ref name=adp5f_3_133/&gt; Significant [[ellipsoid]]al deformations have recently been shown to occur for sulfur ions in [[pyrite]]-type compounds.&lt;ref name=pssb245_9_1858/&gt;

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of [[light]] (400–700&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) so they can not be viewed using an [[optical microscope]]. However, individual atoms can be observed using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1&amp;nbsp;million carbon atoms in width.&lt;ref name=osu2007/&gt; A single drop of water contains about 2&amp;nbsp;[[sextillion]] ({{val|2|e=21}}) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Padilla ''et al.'' (2002:32)—&quot;There are 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's 2&amp;nbsp;sextillion) atoms of oxygen in one drop of water—and twice as many atoms of hydrogen.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A single [[Carat (unit)|carat]] [[diamond]] with a mass of {{val|2|e=-4|u=kg}} contains about 10&amp;nbsp;sextillion (10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) atoms of [[carbon]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;A carat is 200&amp;nbsp;milligrams. [[Atomic mass|By definition]], carbon-12 has 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg per mole. The [[Avogadro constant]] defines {{val|6|e=23}} atoms per mole.&lt;/ref&gt; If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.{{sfn|Feynman|1995|p=5}}

===Radioactive decay===
{{Main|Radioactive decay}}

[[File:Isotopes and half-life.svg|right|300px|thumb|This diagram shows the [[half-life]] (T&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt;) of various isotopes with Z protons and N neutrons.]]

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;fm.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:{{sfn|L'Annunziata|2003|pp=3–56}}&lt;ref name=firestone20000522/&gt;
*[[Alpha decay]] is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].
*[[Beta decay]] is regulated by the [[weak force]], and results from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The first is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while the second causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. A common analog of positron beta decay in nuclei that are proton-rich is [[electron capture]] where an electron is absorbed by the nucleus rather than a positron emitted. A [[neutrino]] is still emitted in this process, and a proton again changes to a neutron.
*[[Gamma decay]] results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. This can occur following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle from radioactive decay.

Other more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]], or result (through [[internal conversion]]) in production of high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, and high-energy photons that are not gamma rays.

Each [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period—the [[half-life]]—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.&lt;ref name=splung/&gt;

===Magnetic moment===
{{Main|Electron magnetic dipole moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}}

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½&amp;nbsp;ħ, or &quot;spin-½&quot;. In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.&lt;ref name=hornak2006/&gt;

The [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom—its [[magnetic moment]]—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.&lt;ref name=schroeder2/&gt;

In [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.&lt;ref name=schroeder2/&gt;&lt;ref name=goebel20070901/&gt;

The nucleus of an atom can also have a net spin. Normally these nuclei are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]]. This has important applications in [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref name=yarris1997/&gt;{{sfn|Liang|Haacke|1999|pp=412–426}}

===Energy levels===
{{Main|Energy level|Atomic spectral line}}

When an electron is bound to an atom, it has a [[potential energy]] that is inversely proportional to its distance from the nucleus. This is measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). In the quantum mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level. The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, while an electron at a higher energy level is in an excited state.&lt;ref name=zeghbroeck1998/&gt;

For an electron to transition between two different states, it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels. The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowles (1989:227–233).&lt;/ref&gt; Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.&lt;ref name=martin2007/&gt;

[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|300px|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]]

When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[Spectral line|emission lines]] from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.&lt;ref name=avogadro/&gt;

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin-orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/&gt; When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.&lt;ref name=weiss2001/&gt; The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].{{sfn|Beyer|2003|pp=232–236}}

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.&lt;ref name=watkins_sjsu/&gt;

===Valence and bonding behavior===
{{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}}

The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell, and the electrons in
that shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]]
behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.&lt;ref name=reusch20070716/&gt; For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]].&lt;ref name=chemguide/&gt;

The [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=husted20031211/&gt;&lt;ref name=baum2003/&gt;

===States===
{{Main|State of matter|Phase (matter)}}

[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Snapshots illustrating the formation of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]
Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and plasmas.
{{sfn|Goodstein|2002|pp=436–438}} Within a state, a material can also exist in different phases. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as [[graphite]] or [[diamond]].&lt;ref name=pu49_7_719/&gt;

At temperatures close to [[absolute zero]], atoms can form a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.{{sfn|Myers|2003|p=85}}&lt;ref name=nist_bec/&gt; This super-cooled collection of atoms
then behaves as a single [[super atom]], which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.&lt;ref name=colton_fyffe1999/&gt;

[[Surface reconstruction|Reconstruction]] causes the surface atoms to deviate from the bulk [[crystal structure]] and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them.]]
The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the [[quantum tunneling]] phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an [[adsorb]]ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the [[Fermi level]] [[local density of states]].&lt;ref name=jacox1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=nf_physics1986/&gt;

An atom can be [[ion]]ized by removing one of its electrons. The [[electric charge]] causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a [[magnetic field]]. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] uses this principle to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.&lt;ref name=sab53_13_1739/&gt;

A more area-selective method is [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], which measures the energy loss of an [[electron beam]] within a [[transmission electron microscope]] when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The [[atom probe|atom-probe tomograph]] has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name=rsi39_1_83/&gt;

Spectra of [[excited state]]s can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant [[star]]s. Specific light [[wavelength]]s contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a [[gas-discharge lamp]] containing the same element.&lt;ref name=lochner2007/&gt; [[Helium]] was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23&amp;nbsp;years before it was found on Earth.&lt;ref name=winter2007/&gt;

==Origin and current state==
Atoms form about 4% of the total energy density of the observable [[universe]], with an average density of about 0.25&amp;nbsp;atoms/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=hinshaw20060210/&gt; Within a galaxy such as the [[Milky Way]], atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; atoms/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Choppin|Liljenzin|Rydberg|2001|p=441}} The Sun is believed to be inside the [[Local Bubble]], a region of highly ionized gas, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; atoms/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=science259_5093_327/&gt; Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about 10% of the mass of the galaxy.{{sfn|Lequeux|2005|p=4}} (The remainder of the mass is an unknown [[dark matter]].)&lt;ref name=nigel2000/&gt;

===Nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Nucleosynthesis}}
Stable protons and electrons appeared one second after the [[Big Bang]]. During the following three minutes, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] produced most of the [[helium]], [[lithium]], and [[deuterium]] in the universe, and perhaps some of the [[beryllium]] and [[boron]].&lt;ref name=ns1794_42/&gt;&lt;ref name=science267_5195_192/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinshaw20051215/&gt; The first atoms (complete with bound electrons) were theoretically created 380,000&amp;nbsp;years after the Big Bang—an epoch called [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Recombination: ca 377,000 years|recombination]], when the expanding universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.&lt;ref name=abbott20070530/&gt;

Since the Big Bang, which produced no carbon, atomic nuclei have been combined in [[star]]s through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] to produce more of the element [[helium]], and (via the [[triple alpha process]]) the sequence of elements from [[carbon]] up to iron.&lt;ref name=mnras106_343/&gt;

Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through [[cosmic ray spallation]].&lt;ref name=nature405_656/&gt; This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.

Elements heavier than iron were produced in [[supernova]]e through the [[r-process]] and in [[Asymptotic giant branch|AGB stars]] through the [[s-process]], both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.&lt;ref name=mashnik2000/&gt; Elements such as [[lead]] formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.&lt;ref name=kgs20050504/&gt;

===Earth===

Most of the atoms that make up the [[Earth]] and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the [[nebula]] that collapsed out of a [[molecular cloud]] to form the [[Solar System]]. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the [[age of the Earth]] through [[radiometric dating]].{{sfn|Manuel|2001|pp=407–430,511–519}}&lt;ref name=gs190_1_205/&gt; Most of the [[helium]] in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of [[helium-3]]) is a product of [[alpha decay]].&lt;ref name=anderson_foulger_meibom2006/&gt;

There are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning (i.e., not &quot;primordial&quot;), nor are results of radioactive decay. [[Carbon-14]] is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pennicott2001/&gt; Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions.&lt;ref name=yarris2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr119_6_2000/&gt; Of the [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]]—those with atomic numbers greater than 92—only [[plutonium]] and [[neptunium]] occur naturally on Earth.&lt;ref name=poston1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=cz97_10_522/&gt; Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth{{sfn|Zaider|Rossi|2001|p=17}} and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of [[plutonium-244]] possibly deposited by cosmic dust.{{sfn|Manuel|2001|pp=407–430,511–519}} Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by [[neutron capture]] in uranium ore.&lt;ref name=ofr_cut/&gt;

The Earth contains approximately {{val|1.33|e=50}} atoms.&lt;ref name=weisenberger/&gt; In the planet's atmosphere, small numbers of independent atoms of [[noble gas]]es exist, such as [[argon]] and [[neon]]. The remaining 99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. At the surface of the Earth, atoms combine to form various compounds, including [[water]], [[salt]], [[silicate]]s and [[oxide]]s. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including [[crystal]]s and liquid or solid [[metal]]s.&lt;ref name=pidwirnyf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas99_22_13966/&gt; This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.{{sfn|Pauling|1960|pp=5–10}}

===Rare and theoretical forms===
While isotopes with atomic numbers higher than [[lead]] (82) are known to be radioactive, an &quot;[[island of stability]]&quot; has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These [[superheavy element]]s may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.&lt;ref name=cern28509/&gt; The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom, [[unbihexium]], has 126&amp;nbsp;protons and 184&amp;nbsp;neutrons.&lt;ref name=cen84_10_19/&gt;

Each particle of matter has a corresponding [[antimatter]] particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the [[positron]] is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. (The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although the [[baryogenesis]] theories may offer an explanation.) As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.&lt;ref name=koppes1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=cromie20010816/&gt; However, in 1996, [[antihydrogen]], the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen, was synthesized at the [[CERN]] laboratory in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=nature419_6906_439/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20021030/&gt;

Other [[exotic atom]]s have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive [[muon]], forming a [[muonic atom]]. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.&lt;ref name=ns1728_77/&gt;&lt;ref name=psT112_1_20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ripin1998/&gt;

'''Andrey (Andrei) Andreyevich Markov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Андре́евич Ма́рков}}, in older works also spelled '''Markoff'''&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite journal |author=Shannon, Claude E. |authorlink=Claude Shannon |title=[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]] |link=[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]] |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=379–423 |date=July/October 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) (14 June 1856 [[New Style|N.S.]]&amp;nbsp;– 20 July 1922) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]]. He is best known for his work on [[stochastic process]]es. A primary subject of his research later became known as [[Markov chain]]s and [[Markov process]]es.

Markov and his younger brother [[Vladimir Andreevich Markov]] (1871–1897) proved [[Markov brothers' inequality]].
His son, another [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrei Andreevich Markov]] (1903–1979), was also a notable mathematician, making contributions to [[constructive mathematics]] and [[recursive function]] theory.

== Biography ==
Andrey Andreyevich Markov was born in [[Ryazan]] as the son of the secretary of the public forest management of Ryazan, Andrey Grigorevich Markov, and his first wife Nadezhda Petrovna Markova.

In the beginning of the 1860s Andrey Grigorevich moved to St. Petersburg to become an asset manager of the princess Ekaterina Aleksandrovna Valvatyeva.

In 1866, Andrey Andreevich's school life began with his entrance into St. Petersburg's fifth grammar school. Already during his school time Andrey was intensely engaged in higher mathematics. As a 17-year-old grammar school student, he informed [[Viktor Bunyakovsky]], [[Aleksandr Korkin]], and [[Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev]] about an apparently new method to solve [[linear ordinary differential equations]], and he was invited to the so-called Korkin Saturdays, where Korkin's students regularly met. In 1874, he finished the school and began his studies at the physico-mathematical faculty of [[St. Petersburg University]].

Among his teachers were [[Yulian Sokhotski]] (differential calculus, higher algebra), [[Konstantin Posse]] (analytic geometry), Yegor Zolotarev (integral calculus), [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]] (number theory and  probability theory), [[Aleksandr Korkin]] (ordinary and partial differential equations), Okatov (first name unknown) (mechanism theory), [[Osip Somov]] (mechanics), and Budaev (first name unknown) (descriptive and higher geometry).

In [[1877]], Markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem&lt;br&gt; 

''About Integration of Differential Equations by Continuous Fractions with an Application to the Equation'' &lt;math&gt; (1+x^2) \frac{dy}{dx} = n (1+y^2).&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

During the following year, he passed the candidate's examinations, and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturer's position.

In April 1880, Markov defended his [[master's degree|master's thesis]] &quot;About Binary Quadratic Forms with Positive Determinant&quot;, which was encouraged by Aleksandr Korkin and Yegor Zolotarev.

Five years later, in January 1885, there followed his doctoral thesis &quot;About Some Applications of Algebraic Continuous Fractions&quot;.

His [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] work began after the defense of his master's thesis in autumn 1880. As a [[privatdozent]] he lectured on differential and integral calculus. Later he lectured alternately on &quot;introduction to analysis&quot;, probability theory (succeeding Chebyshev, who had left the university in [[1882]]) and the calculus of differences. From 1895 through 1905 he also lectured in [[differential calculus]].

One year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, Markov was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the Academy of Sciences. In 1890, after the death of Viktor Bunyakovsky, Markov became an extraordinary member of the academy. His promotion to an ordinary professor of St. Petersburg University followed in the fall of 1894.

In 1896, Markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of [[Chebyshev]]. In 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately. Until 1910, however, he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences.

In connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of St. Petersburg University were ordered to monitor their students. Markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an &quot;agent of the governance&quot;. Markov was removed from further teaching duties at St. Petersburg University, and hence he decided to retire from the university.

In 1913, the council of St. Petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university. Markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. The affirmation only occurred four years later, after the February revolution in 1917. Markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in 1922.

== Excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church ==
In 1912, Markov, protesting [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s excommunication from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and since he was an [[atheist]] himself, he requested that he be excommunicated, too. In response, the Church formally excommunicated him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Of course, Markov, an atheist and eventual excommunicate of the Church quarreled endlessly with his equally outspoken counterpart Nekrasov. The disputes between Markov and Nekrasov were not limited to mathematics and religion, they quarreled over political and philosophical issues as well.&quot;  Gely P. Basharin, Amy N. Langville, Valeriy A. Naumov,  [https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/meyn/www/spm_files/Markov-Work-and-life.pdf The Life and Work of A. A. Markov], page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Naming Infinity: A True Story of Religious Mysticism and Mathematical Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03293-4|coauthors=Loren R.

An '''axiom''' is a premise or starting point of reasoning. As classically conceived, an axiom is a premise so evident as to be accepted as true without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law&quot; axiom, n., definition 1a. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' I.2.72a18-b4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL SOURCED —it is better known and more firmly believed than the conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}--&gt;
The word comes from the Greek ἀξίωμα 'that which is thought worthy or fit,' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'&lt;ref&gt;Cf. axiom, n., etymology. ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford American College Dictionary: &quot;n. a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. ORIGIN: late 15th cent.: ultimately from Greek axiōma 'what is thought fitting,' from axios 'worthy.' http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O997-axiom.html {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As used in modern [[logic]], an axiom is simply a premise or starting point for reasoning,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A proposition (whether true or false)&quot; axiom, n., definition 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and equivalent to what [[Aristotle]] calls a [[definition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' I.2.72a23&lt;/ref&gt; Axioms define and delimit the realm of [[analysis]]. In other words, an axiom is a logical [[statement]] that is assumed to be [[truth|true]]. Therefore, its truth is taken for granted within the particular domain of analysis, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory and domain dependent) truths. An axiom is defined as a [[mathematical]] statement that is accepted as being true without a [[mathematical proof]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Sundstorm, &quot;Mathematical reasoning: writing and proof,&quot; Prentice Hall, 2003, p 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the term ''axiom'' is used in two related but distinguishable senses: [[#Logical axioms|&quot;logical axioms&quot;]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|&quot;non-logical axioms&quot;]]. In both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Unlike [[theorem]]s, axioms (unless redundant) cannot be derived by principles of deduction, nor are they demonstrable by [[mathematical proof]]s, simply because they are starting points; there is nothing else from which they logically follow (otherwise they would be classified as theorems).

Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be universally true (e.g., (''A'' and ''B'') implies ''A''), while non-logical axioms (e.g., {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}) are actually defining properties for the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as [[arithmetic]]). When used in the latter sense, &quot;axiom,&quot; &quot;postulate&quot;, and &quot;assumption&quot; may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;axiom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἀξίωμα}} (''axioma''), a [[verbal noun]] from the verb {{lang|grc|ἀξιόειν}} (''axioein''), meaning &quot;to deem worthy&quot;, but also &quot;to require&quot;, which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|ἄξιος}} (''axios''), meaning &quot;being in balance&quot;, and hence &quot;having (the same) value (as)&quot;, &quot;worthy&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;. Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

The root meaning of the word 'postulate' is to 'demand'; for instance, [[Euclid]] demands of us that we agree that some things can  be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, P.  Breakthroughs in Mathematics, 1963, New York: New American Library, pp&amp;nbsp;47–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting Euclid's books [[Proclus]] remarks that &quot;[[Geminus]] held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.]] 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. ''p200''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] translated 'postulate' as ''petitio'' and called the axioms  ''notiones communes'' but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

==Historical development==
===Early Greeks===
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments ([[syllogisms]], rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. [[tautology (logic)|Tautologies]] excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ([[theorem]]s, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms ''axiom'' and ''postulate'' hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].

The ancient Greeks considered [[geometry]] as just one of several [[science]]s{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's [[posterior analytics]] is a definitive exposition of the classical view.

An &quot;axiom&quot;, in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that &lt;blockquote&gt;''When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a ''postulate''. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b &quot;Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind. – And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on which truth should be accepted, are due to want of training in logic; for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on it.&quot; W.D. Ross translation, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon, (Random House, New York, 1941)|date=June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical approach is well illustrated by [[Euclid's Elements]], where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of &quot;common notions&quot; (very basic, self-evident assertions).

:;Postulates
:# It is possible to draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any other point.
:# It is possible to extend a [[line segment]] continuously in a straight line.
:# It is possible to describe a [[circle]] with any center and any radius.
:# It is true that all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.
:# (&quot;[[Parallel postulate]]&quot;) It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the [[polygon|interior angles]] on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] on that side on which are the [[angles]] less than the two right angles.

:;Common notions:
:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
:# The whole is greater than the part.

===Modern development===
A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, [[propositional logic|propositions]], theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Mario Pieri]], and [[Giuseppe Peano]] were pioneers in this movement.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[group (mathematics)|group theory]], [[topological space|topology]], [[linear space|vector spaces]]) without ''any'' particular application in mind. The distinction between an &quot;axiom&quot; and a &quot;postulate&quot; disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, [[hyperbolic geometry]] for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like &quot;line&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.

When mathematicians employ the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are &quot;propositions that are regarded as true without proof.&quot; Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and [[logic]] itself can be regarded as a branch of mathematics. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] are some of the key figures in this development.

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any [[Class (set theory)|collection]] of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be [[consistent]]; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of [[Euclidean geometry]], and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]. Here the emergence of [[Russell's paradox]], and similar antinomies of [[naïve set theory]] raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.

The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ([[peano arithmetic|Peano's axioms]], for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a [[corollary]], Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like [[Peano arithmetic]] is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of [[natural number]]s, an [[Infinity|infinite]] but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory. The [[axiom of choice]], a key hypothesis of this theory, remains a very controversial assumption. Furthermore, using techniques of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] ([[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Cohen]]) one can show that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

===Other sciences===
Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in [[theoretical physics]]. In particular, the monumental work of [[Isaac Newton]] is essentially based on [[Euclid]]'s axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of [[spacetime]] and the physics taking place in it at any moment.

In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]], and later on by those of [[general relativity]].

Another paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see [[EPR paradox]]), almost immediately contradicted by [[Niels Bohr]], concerned the interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be [[Probability theory|probabilistic]], whereas according to Einstein it should be [[deterministic]]. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of &quot;theorems&quot; derived by it, seemed to be  identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  &quot;hidden variables&quot; to enforce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in  1964,  [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see [[Bell inequalities]]), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of [[Alain Aspect]] got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].)

As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;locality&quot; of experiments.

Regardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither &quot;proves&quot; nor &quot;disproves&quot; an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a [[Falsification|falsified]] physical theory needs [[modification]].

==Mathematical logic==
In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: ''logical'' and ''non-logical'' (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between &quot;axioms&quot; and &quot;postulates&quot; respectively).

===Logical axioms===

These are certain [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] in a [[formal language]] that are universally [[validity|valid]], that is, formulas that are [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignment]] of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms ''at least'' some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in the language; in the case of [[predicate logic]] more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove [[logical truth]]s that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

====Examples====
=====Propositional logic=====

In [[propositional logic]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulae of the language and where the included [[Logical connective|primitive connectives]] are only &quot;&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;&quot; for [[negation]] of the immediately following proposition and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\to\,&lt;/math&gt;&quot; for [[Entailment|implication]] from antecedent to consequent propositions:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi).&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are [[propositional variable]]s, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

Other axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;6. Other Axiomatizations&quot; of Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;3. First-Order Theories&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mathematical logic=====
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom of Equality.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order language]]. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Free variables and bound variables|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,,&lt;/math&gt; the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt;  (or, for that matter, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt;  has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example [[axiom scheme]], is that which provides us with what is known as '''Universal Instantiation''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that is [[First-order logic#Rules of inference|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

Where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; with the term &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; substituted for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[Substitution of variables]].) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''Existential Generalization''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x \, \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===

'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''[[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.&lt;!-- This turned out to be impossible{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]''); however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of [[neo-logicism]].--&gt;

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''[[deductive system]]'''.

====Examples====
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of [[axiomatic set theory]] like [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as [[Morse-Kelley set theory]] or set theory with a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]] allowing the use of a [[Grothendieck universe]] are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as [[second-order arithmetic]].

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

[[Combinatorics]] is an example of a field of mathematics which does not, in general, follow the axiomatic method.

=====Arithmetic=====
The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[first-order arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;5. The Fixed Point Theorem. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;((\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}\,&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\ &lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]].  The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.  This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries. If one also removes the second postulate (&quot;a line can be extended indefinitely&quot;) then [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]] geometry arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.

=====Real analysis=====
The object of study is the [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''Dedekind complete ordered field'', meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===
====Deductive systems and completeness====
A '''[[deductive]] system''' consists of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{if }\Sigma \models \phi\text{ then }\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;.  [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of ''completeness of a deductive system'' and on the other hand that of ''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===
Early [[mathematician]]s regarded [[axiomatic geometry]] as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

[[Image:Absolute value.svg|thumb|360px|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of the absolute value function for real numbers]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' (or '''modulus''') {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}} of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} is the numerical value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. So, for example, the absolute value of&amp;nbsp;3 is 3, and the absolute value of&amp;nbsp;–3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.

Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.

==Terminology and notation==
[[Jean-Robert Argand]] introduced the term &quot;module&quot; 'unit of measure' in French in 1806 specifically for the ''complex'' absolute value&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0691027951 Nahin], [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html O'Connor and Robertson], and [http://functions.wolfram.com/ComplexComponents/Abs/35/ functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Littré]], 1877&lt;/ref&gt; and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent &quot;modulus&quot;.&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; The term &quot;absolute value&quot; has been used in this sense since at least 1806 in French&lt;ref&gt;[[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot|Lazare Nicolas M. Carnot]], ''Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace'', p.&amp;nbsp;105 [http://books.google.com/books?id=YyIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1857 in English.&lt;ref&gt;James Mill Peirce, ''A Text-book of Analytic Geometry'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=RJALAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 at Google Books].  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term &quot;absolute value&quot; is also used in contrast to &quot;relative value&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The notation {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}} was introduced by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Higham, ''Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences'', SIAM. ISBN 0-89871-420-6, p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for ''absolute value'' include &quot;the numerical value&quot;&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; and &quot;the magnitude&quot;.&lt;ref name=oed /&gt;

The same notation is used with sets to denote [[cardinality]]; the meaning depends on context.

==Definition and properties==
===Real numbers===
For any [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} is denoted by {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}} (a [[vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as&lt;ref&gt; Mendelson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A8hAm38zsCMC&amp;pg=PA2 p.&amp;nbsp;2].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} is always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0 (number)|zero]], but never [[negative number|negative]].

From an [[analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[distance]] from zero along the [[real number line]], and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of  the absolute value of the difference (see [[#Distance|&quot;Distance&quot;]] below).

Since the [[square-root]] notation without sign represents the ''positive'' square root, it follows that

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|1}})
|}

which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Stewart, James B. | coauthors= | title=Calculus: concepts and contexts | year=2001 | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Australia  | isbn=0-534-37718-1 | pages=}}, p.&amp;nbsp;A5&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties:

|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a-b| \ge ||a| - |b|| &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|11}})
|(equivalent to subadditivity)
|}

Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x-3| \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -6 \le x \le 12 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Absolute value is used to define the [[absolute difference]], the standard metric on the real numbers.

===Complex numbers===
[[Image:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|z}} is the distance&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|r}} from {{mvar|z}} to the origin. It is also seen in the picture that {{mvar|z}} and its [[complex conjugate]]&amp;nbsp;{{overline|''z''}} have the same absolute value.]]

Since the [[complex number]]s are not [[Totally ordered set|ordered]], the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalized. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance in the [[complex plane]] from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. More generally the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.

For any complex number

:&lt;math&gt;z = x + iy,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|z}} is denoted {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''z''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}} and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

When  the complex part {{mvar|y}} is zero this is the same as the absolute value of the real number&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.

When a complex number ''z'' is expressed in [[Complex number#Polar form|polar form]] as

:&lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{mvar|r}} ≥ 0 and &amp;theta; real, its absolute value is 

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = r&lt;/math&gt;.

The absolute value of a complex number can be written in the complex analogue of equation&amp;nbsp;[[#math 1|(1)]] above as: 

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z \cdot \overline{z}}&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex conjugate]] of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|z}}.
 
The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in equations&amp;nbsp;[[#math 2|(2)–(11)]] above.

Since the positive reals form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, we may think of absolute value as an [[endomorphism]] of the [[multiplicative group]] of the complex numbers.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Absolute value function==
The real absolute value function is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere. It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval {{open-closed|−∞,0}} and monotonically increasing on the interval {{closed-open|0,+∞}}. Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[invertible]].

Both the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].

It is a [[nonlinear]] [[convex function|convex]] function.

===Relationship to other functions===
Where the absolute value function of a real number returns a value without respect to its sign, the [[sign function|sign (or signum) function]] returns a number's sign without respect to its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions:

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = a \sgn(a),&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\sgn(a) = \frac{|a|}{a}&lt;/math&gt; for ''a'' &amp;ne; 0.

One form of the [[Heaviside step function]] used in signal processing is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; u(x) =
  \begin{cases} 0,           &amp; x &lt; 0
             \\ \frac{1}{2}, &amp; x = 0
             \\ 1,           &amp; x &gt; 0,
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the value of the Heaviside function at zero is conventional.  This function can be written in terms of the sign function as

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \frac{\sgn(x) +1}{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

So for all nonzero points on the [[real number line]] we have

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \frac{x + |x|}{2|x|}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivative===
The [[derivative]] of the real absolute value function is given by the [[step function]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MathWorld&quot;&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbsoluteValue.html Weisstein, Eric W. ''Absolute Value.'' From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BS163&quot;&gt;Bartel and Sherbert, p.&amp;nbsp;163&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d|x|}{dx} = \frac{x}{|x|} = \begin{cases} -1 &amp; x&lt;0 \\ \text{undefined} &amp; x = 0 \\ 1 &amp; x&gt;0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[subderivative|subdifferential]] of &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|−1,1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wriggers, Panagiotis Panatiotopoulos, eds., ''New Developments in Contact Problems'', 1999, ISBN 3-211-83154-1, [http://books.google.com/books?id=tiBtC4GmuKcC&amp;pg=PA31 p.&amp;nbsp;31–32]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[complex number|complex]] absolute value function is continuous everywhere but [[complex differentiable]] ''nowhere'' because it violates the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MathWorld&quot;/&gt;

The second derivative of&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''x''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}} with respect to&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is zero everywhere except zero, where it is undefined. As a [[generalized function]], the second derivative may be taken to equal two times the [[Dirac delta function]].

===Antiderivative===
The [[antiderivative]] (indefinite integral) of the absolute value function is

:&lt;math&gt;\int|x|dx=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|C}} is an arbitrary [[constant of integration]].

==Distance==
{{see also|Metric space}}
The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.

The standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points

:&lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n) &lt;/math&gt;

in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space]] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen to be a generalization of {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''a'' − ''b''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}}, since if {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real, then by [[#math 1|equation&amp;nbsp;(1)]],
:&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

While if

:&lt;math&gt; a = a_1 + i a_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; b = b_1 + i b_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

are complex numbers, then

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above shows that the &quot;absolute value&quot; distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.

The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:

A real valued function {{mvar|d}} on a set {{math|''X''&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;''X''}} is called a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (or a ''distance function'') on {{mvar|X}}, if it satisfies the following four axioms:&lt;ref&gt;These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: {{math|1=0 = ''d''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''d''(''a'', ''b'') + ''d''(''b'', ''a'') = 2''d''(''a'', ''b'')}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|-
|style=&quot;width:250px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;d(a, b) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = d(b, a) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Symmetry
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b)  \le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Triangle inequality
|}

==Generalizations==
===Ordered rings===
The definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can easily be extended to any [[ordered ring]]. That is, if&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} is an element of an ordered ring ''R'', then the '''absolute value''' of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}}, denoted by {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}}, is defined to be:&lt;ref&gt;Mac Lane, [http://books.google.com/books?id=L6FENd8GHIUC&amp;pg=PA264 p.264].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a \le 0 \end{cases} \; &lt;/math&gt;

where −{{mvar|a}} is the [[additive inverse]] of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}}, and 0 is the additive [[identity element]].

===Fields===
{{main|Absolute value (algebra)}}
The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in [[#math 2|(2)]]–(5) above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.

A real-valued function&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|v}} on a [[field (mathematics)|field]]&amp;nbsp;''F'' is called an ''absolute value'' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'')&lt;ref&gt;Shechter, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&amp;pg=PA260 p. 260]. This meaning of ''valuation'' is rare. Usually, a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value&lt;/ref&gt; if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) = 0 \iff a = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Multiplicativeness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a+b)  \le v(a) + v(b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

Where '''0''' denotes the additive [[identity element]] of&amp;nbsp;''F''. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativeness that {{math|1=''v''('''1''') = 1}}, where '''1''' denotes the multiplicative identity element of&amp;nbsp;''F''. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.

If {{mvar|v}} is an absolute value on&amp;nbsp;''F'', then the function&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|d}} on {{math|''F''&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;''F''}}, defined by {{math|1=''d''(''a'', ''b'') = ''v''(''a'' − ''b'')}}, is a metric and the following are equivalent:

* ''d'' satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) \leq \max(d(x,z),d(y,z))&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} in&amp;nbsp;''F''.

* &lt;math&gt; \big\{ v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) : n \in \mathbb{N} \big\} &lt;/math&gt; is [[bounded set|bounded]] in&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

* &lt;math&gt; v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) \le 1 \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a) \le 1 \Rightarrow v(1+a) \le 1 \text{ for all } a \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a + b) \le \mathrm{max}\{v(a), v(b)\} \text{ for all } a, b \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].&lt;ref&gt;Shechter, [http://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&amp;pg=PA260 pp. 260&amp;ndash;261].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector spaces===
{{Main|Norm (mathematics)}}
Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.

A real-valued function on a [[vector space]]&amp;nbsp;''V'' over a field&amp;nbsp;''F'', represented as ||''V''||, is called an '''absolute value''' (or more usually a '''norm''') if it satisfies the following axioms:

For all&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} in&amp;nbsp;''F'', and '''v''', '''u''' in&amp;nbsp;''V'',

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\|  \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\| = 0 \iff \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|a \mathbf{v}\| = |a| \|\mathbf{v}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \|\mathbf{u}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

The norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.

In the case of [[Euclidean space]]&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\|(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers&amp;nbsp;'''R''' are considered as the one-dimensional vector space&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the {{mvar|p}}-norm for any&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|p}}. In fact the absolute value is the &quot;only&quot; norm on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense that, for every norm {{math|&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;}} on&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, {{math|1=&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''x''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; = &amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;1&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;&amp;thinsp;''x''&amp;thinsp;&amp;#124;}}. The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]]&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], an '''algebraically closed field''' ''F'' contains a [[Zero of a function|root]] for every [[Degree of a polynomial|non-constant polynomial]] in ''F''[''x''], the [[ring of polynomials]] in the variable ''x'' with coefficients in ''F''.

==Examples==
As an example, the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp; has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real.  The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of [[rational number]]s is not algebraically closed. Also, no [[finite field]] ''F'' is algebraically closed, because if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the elements of ''F'', then the polynomial (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
has no zero in ''F''. By contrast, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the field of [[complex number]]s is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) [[algebraic number]]s.

==Equivalent properties==
Given a field ''F'', the assertion “''F'' is algebraically closed” is equivalent to other assertions:

===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if the only [[irreducible polynomial]]s in the [[polynomial ring]] ''F''[''x''] are those of degree one.

The assertion “the polynomials of degree one are irreducible” is trivially true for any field. If ''F'' is algebraically closed and ''p''(''x'') is an irreducible polynomial of ''F''[''x''], then it has some root ''a'' and therefore ''p''(''x'') is a multiple of ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, this means that ''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0}. On the other hand, if ''F'' is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial ''p''(''x'') in ''F''[''x''] without roots in ''F''. Let ''q''(''x'') be some irreducible factor of ''p''(''x''). Since ''p''(''x'') has no roots in ''F'', ''q''(''x'') also has no roots in ''F''. Therefore, ''q''(''x'') has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in ''F''.

===Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial ''p''(''x'') of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, with [[coefficient]]s in ''F'', [[factorization|splits into linear factors]]. In other words, there are elements ''k'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the field ''F'' such that ''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'').

If ''F'' has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in ''F''[''x''] has some root in ''F''; in other words, ''F'' is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for ''F'' if ''F'' is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field ''K'', any polynomial in ''K''[''x''] can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.

===Polynomials of prime degree have roots===
J. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over ''F'' of prime degree has a root in ''F'', then every non-constant polynomial has a root in ''F'', thus ''F'' is algebraically closed.

===The field has no proper algebraic extension===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper [[algebraic extension]].

If ''F'' has no proper algebraic extension, let ''p''(''x'') be some irreducible polynomial in ''F''[''x'']. Then the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of ''F''[''x''] modulo the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''p''(''x'') is an algebraic extension of ''F'' whose [[degree of a field extension|degree]] is equal to the degree of ''p''(''x''). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of ''p''(''x'') is&amp;nbsp;1.

On the other hand, if ''F'' has some proper algebraic extension ''K'', then the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of an element in ''K''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''F'' is irreducible and its degree is greater than&amp;nbsp;1.

===The field has no proper finite extension===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite [[algebraic extension]] because if, within the [[Algebraically closed field#The field has no proper algebraic extension|previous proof]], the word “algebraic” is replaced by the word “finite”, then the proof is still valid.

===Every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has some eigenvector===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number ''n'', every [[linear map]] from ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself has some [[eigenvector]].

An endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has an eigenvector if and only if its [[characteristic polynomial]] has some root. Therefore, when ''F'' is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has an eigenvector, let ''p''(''x'') be an element of ''F''[''x'']. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial ''q''(''x'') which has roots if and only if ''p''(''x'') has roots. But if ''q''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''q''(''x'') is the characteristic polynomial of the [[companion matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_0\\1&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_1\\0&amp;1&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;-a_2\\\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots\\0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;1&amp;-a_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Decomposition of rational expressions===
The field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every [[rational function]] in one variable ''x'', with coefficients in ''F'', can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''F''.

If ''F'' is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in ''F''[''x''] are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the [[Partial fraction decomposition#Statement of theorem|theorem on partial fraction decomposition]].

On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field ''F''. Let ''p''(''x'') be an irreducible element in ''F''[''x'']. Then the rational function 1/''p'' can be written as the sum of a polynomial function ''q'' with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the rational expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac1{p(x)}-q(x)=\frac{1-p(x)q(x)}{p(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.

===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===
For any field ''F'', if two polynomials ''p''(''x''),''q''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''[''x''] are [[coprime|relatively prime]] then they don't have a common root, for if ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' was a common root, then&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'') and &amp;nbsp;''q''(''x'') would both be multiples of ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.

If the field ''F'' is algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'') two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let ''r''(''x'') be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then, since ''r''(''x'') is not constant, it will have some root ''a'', which will be then a common root of ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'').

If ''F'' is not algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then ''p''(''x'') and ''p''(''x'') are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).

==Other properties==
If ''F'' is an algebraically closed field and ''n'' is a natural number, then ''F'' contains all ''n''th roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the ''n'' (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a ''cyclotomic extension'', and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its ''cyclotomic closure''. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.

If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of [[first-order logic]] is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic&amp;nbsp;0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic&amp;nbsp;0, but there is some natural number ''N'' such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic&amp;nbsp;''p'' when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;N.&lt;ref&gt;See subsections ''Rings and fields'' and ''Properties of mathematical theories'' in §2 of J. Barwise's &quot;An introduction to first-order logic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every field ''F'' has some extension which is algebraically closed. Among all such extensions there is one and ([[Up to|up to isomorphism]], but not [[essentially unique|unique isomorphism]]) only one which is an [[algebraic extension]] of ''F'';&lt;ref&gt;See Lang's ''Algebra'', §VII.2 or van der Waerden's ''Algebra I'', §10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; it is called the [[algebraic closure]] of ''F''.

The theory of algebraically closed fields has [[quantifier elimination]].

'''Algorithms for calculating variance''' play a major role in [[statistics|statistical]] computing. A key problem in the design of good [[algorithm]]s for this problem is that formulas for the [[variance]] may involve sums of squares, which can lead to [[numerical instability]] as well as to [[arithmetic overflow]] when dealing with large values.

==Naïve algorithm==
A formula for calculating the variance of an entire [[statistical population|population]] of size ''n'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2/n}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

A formula for calculating an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] estimate of the population variance from a finite [[statistical sample|sample]] of ''n'' observations is:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2/n}{n-1}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def naive_variance(data):
    n = 0
    Sum = 0
    Sum_sqr = 0
    
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        Sum = Sum + x
        Sum_sqr = Sum_sqr + x*x
     
    variance = (Sum_sqr - ((Sum*Sum)/n))/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by ''n'' instead of ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 on the last line.

Because &lt;code&gt;sum_sqr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sum * mean&lt;/code&gt; can be very similar numbers, the [[precision (arithmetic)|precision]] of the result can be much less than the inherent precision of the [[floating-point]] arithmetic used to perform the computation.  This is particularly bad if the standard deviation is small relative to the mean. However, the algorithm can be improved by adopting the method of the [[assumed mean]].

==Two-pass algorithm==
An alternate approach, using a different formula for the variance, first computes the sample mean,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x = \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n x_j/n&lt;/math&gt;,
and then computes the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean,
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2}{n-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;,
as given by the following pseudocode:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def two_pass_variance(data):
    n    = 0
    sum1 = 0
    sum2 = 0
    
    for x in data:
        n    = n + 1
        sum1 = sum1 + x
    
    mean = sum1/n

    for x in data:
        sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)*(x - mean)
    
    variance = sum2/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm is often more numerically reliable {{vague|date=August 2012}} than the naïve [[#Naïve algorithm|algorithm]] for large sets of data, although it can be worse if much of the data is very close to but not precisely equal to the mean and some are quite far away from it{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.&lt;!-- The first algorithm has less subtractions, that are a common form of losing precision in algorithms implemented in finite precision computers.--&gt;

The results of both of these simple algorithms (I and II) can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums. Techniques such as [[compensated summation]] can be used to combat this error to a degree.

===Compensated variant===
The compensated-summation version of the algorithm above reads{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}:&lt;!--Where did this algorithm come from?  It is not the normal form for a Kahan summation.--&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def compensated_variance(data):
    n = 0
    sum1 = 0
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        sum1 = sum1 + x
    mean = sum1/n
     
    sum2 = 0
    sum3 = 0
    for x in data:
        sum2 = sum2 + (x - mean)**2
        sum3 = sum3 + (x - mean)
    variance = (sum2 - sum3**2/n)/(n - 1)
    return variance
&lt;/source&gt;

==On-line algorithm==
It is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass, inspecting each value &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; only once; for example, when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values, or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation.  For such an [[online algorithm]], a [[recurrence relation]] is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion.

The following formulas can be used to update the [[mean]] and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{new}}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the sample mean of the first ''n'' samples (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; their sample variance, and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; their population variance.

:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_n = \frac{(n-1) \, \bar x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \bar x_{n-1} + \frac{x_n - \bar x_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s^2_n = \frac{(n-2) \, s^2_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n) (x_n - \bar x_{n-1})}{n-1}, \quad n&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_n = \frac{(n-1) \, \sigma^2_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n) \, (x_n - \bar x_{n-1})}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that a more suitable quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the (current) mean, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x_n)^2&lt;/math&gt;, here denoted &lt;math&gt;M_{2,n}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{2,n}\! = M_{2,n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n)(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2_n = \frac{M_{2,n}}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_n = \frac{M_{2,n}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

A numerically stable algorithm is given below.  It also computes the mean.
This algorithm is due to Knuth&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald E. Knuth]] (1998). ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', volume 2: ''Seminumerical Algorithms'', 3rd edn., p. 232. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;, who cites Welford&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Welford (1962).[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1266577 &quot;Note on a method for calculating corrected sums of squares and products&quot;]. ''[[Technometrics]]'' 4(3):419–420.&lt;/ref&gt;, and it has been thoroughly analyzed&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Tony F.; Golub, Gene H.; LeVeque, Randall J. (1983). Algorithms for Computing the Sample Variance: Analysis and Recommendations. The American Statistician 37, 242-247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ling, Robert F. (1974). Comparison of Several Algorithms for Computing Sample Means and Variances. Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 69, No. 348, 859-866. {{doi|10.2307/2286154}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also common to denote &lt;math&gt;M_k = \bar x_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_k = M_{2,k}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johndcook.com/standard_deviation.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def online_variance(data):
    n = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0
     
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        delta = x - mean
        mean = mean + delta/n
        M2 = M2 + delta*(x - mean)
 
    variance_n = M2/n
    variance = M2/(n - 1)
    return (variance, variance_n)
&lt;/source&gt;

This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to [[Catastrophic_cancellation|massive cancellation]], but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop.  For a particularly robust two-pass algorithm for computing the variance, first compute and subtract an estimate of the mean, and then use this algorithm on the residuals.

The [[Algorithms for calculating variance#Parallel_algorithm|parallel algorithm]] below illustrates how to merge multiple sets of statistics calculated on-line.

==Weighted incremental algorithm==
The algorithm can be extended to handle unequal sample weights, replacing the simple counter ''n'' with the sum of weights seen so far.  West (1979)&lt;ref&gt;D. H. D. West (1979). ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', 22, 9, 532-535: ''Updating Mean and Variance Estimates: An Improved Method''&lt;/ref&gt; suggests this incremental algorithm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def weighted_incremental_variance(dataWeightPairs):
    sumweight = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0

    for x, weight in dataWeightPairs:  # Alternately &quot;for x, weight in zip(data, weights):&quot;
        temp = weight + sumweight
        delta = x − mean
        R = delta * weight / temp
        mean = mean + R
        M2 = M2 + sumweight * delta * R  # Alternatively, &quot;M2 = M2 + weight * delta * (x−mean)&quot;
        sumweight = temp

    variance_n = M2/sumweight
    variance = variance_n * len(dataWeightPairs)/(len(dataWeightPairs) − 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta\! = \bar x_B - \bar x_A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_X = \bar x_A + \delta\cdot\frac{n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{2,X} = M_{2,A} + M_{2,B} + \delta^2\cdot\frac{n_A n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;.
This may be useful when, for example, multiple processing units may be assigned to discrete parts of the input.

Chan's method for estimating the mean is numerically unstable when &lt;math&gt;n_A \approx n_B&lt;/math&gt; and both are large, because the numerical error in &lt;math&gt;\bar x_B - \bar x_A&lt;/math&gt; is not scaled down in the way that it is in the &lt;math&gt;n_B = 1&lt;/math&gt; case. In such cases, prefer &lt;math&gt;\bar x_X = \frac{n_A \bar x_A + n_B \bar x_B}{n_A + n_B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Assume that all floating point operations use the standard [[IEEE 754#Double-precision 64 bit|IEEE 754 double-precision]] arithmetic. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30.  Both Algorithm I and Algorithm II compute these values correctly.  Next consider the sample (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;13, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample.  Algorithm II computes this variance estimate correctly, but Algorithm I returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30.  While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of Algorithm I, it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm: Take the sample to be (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;13, 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16).  Again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by Algorithm II, but the naive algorithm now computes it as −170.66666666666666.  This is a serious problem with Algorithm I and is due to [[catastrophic cancellation]] in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.

                    &amp; + 6\delta^2\frac{n_A^2 M_{2,B} + n_B^2 M_{2,A}}{n_X^2} + 4\delta\frac{n_AM_{3,B} - n_BM_{3,A}}{n_X} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt; are again the sums of powers of differences from the mean &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(x - \overline{x})^k&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:skewness: &lt;math&gt;g_1 = \frac{\sqrt{n} M_3}{M_2^{3/2}},&lt;/math&gt;
:kurtosis: &lt;math&gt;g_2 = \frac{n M_4}{M_2^2}-3.&lt;/math&gt;

For the incremental case (i.e., &lt;math&gt;B = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;), this simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta\! = x - m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m' = m + \frac{\delta}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2' = M_2 + \delta^2 \frac{ n-1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_3' = M_3 + \delta^3 \frac{ (n - 1) (n - 2)}{n^2} - \frac{3\delta M_2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_4' = M_4 + \frac{\delta^4 (n - 1) (n^2 - 3n + 3)}{n^3} + \frac{6\delta^2 M_2}{n^2} - \frac{4\delta M_3}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

By preserving the value &lt;math&gt;\delta / n&lt;/math&gt;, only one division operation is needed and the higher-order statistics can thus be calculated for little incremental cost.

An example of the online algorithm for kurtosis implemented as described is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def online_kurtosis(data):
    n = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0
    M3 = 0
    M4 = 0

    for x in data:
        n1 = n
        n = n + 1
        delta = x - mean
        delta_n = delta / n
        delta_n2 = delta_n * delta_n
        term1 = delta * delta_n * n1
        mean = mean + delta_n
        M4 = M4 + term1 * delta_n2 * (n*n - 3*n + 3) + 6 * delta_n2 * M2 - 4 * delta_n * M3
        M3 = M3 + term1 * delta_n * (n - 2) - 3 * delta_n * M2
        M2 = M2 + term1

    kurtosis = (n*M4) / (M2*M2) - 3
    return kurtosis
&lt;/source&gt;

offer two alternate methods to compute the skewness and kurtosis, each of which can save substantial computer memory requirements and CPU time in certain applications. The first approach is to compute the statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resulting histogram, which effectively becomes a one-pass algorithm for higher moments. One benefit is that the statistical moment calculations can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy such that the computations can be tuned to the precision of, e.g., the data storage format or the original measurement hardware.  A relative histogram of a random variable can be constructed in
the conventional way: the range of potential values is
divided into bins and the number of occurrences within each bin are
counted and plotted such that the area of each rectangle equals
the portion of the sample values within that bin:

: &lt;math&gt; H(x_k)=\frac{h(x_k)}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; represent the frequency and
the relative frequency at bin &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A= \sum_{k=1}^{K} h(x_k)
\,\Delta x_k&lt;/math&gt; is the total area of the histogram. After this
normalization, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raw moments and central moments of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
can be calculated from the relative histogram:

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_n^{(h)} = \sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \, H(x_k) \Delta x_k
            = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \, h(x_k) \Delta x_k
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 \theta_n^{(h)}= \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, H(x_k)\Delta x_k
               = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, h(x_k) \Delta x_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where the superscript &lt;math&gt;^{(h)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the moments are
calculated from the histogram. For constant bin width &lt;math&gt;\Delta
x_k=\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; these two expressions can be simplified using &lt;math&gt;I= A/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_n^{(h)}= \frac{1}{I} {\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_k^n \, h(x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 \theta_n^{(h)}= \frac{1}{I}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\Big)^n \, h(x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second approach from Choi and Sweetman
&lt;ref name=&quot;Choi2010&quot; /&gt;
is an analytical methodology to combine statistical moments from individual segments of a time-history such that the resulting overall moments are those of the complete time-history. This methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments, or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times.

If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; sets of statistical moments are known:
&lt;math&gt;(\gamma_{0,q},\mu_{q},\sigma^2_{q},\alpha_{3,q},\alpha_{4,q})
\quad &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;q=1,2,...,Q &lt;/math&gt;, then each &lt;math&gt;\gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; can
be expressed in terms of the equivalent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; raw moments:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \gamma_{n,q}= m_{n,q} \gamma_{0,q} \qquad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=1,2,3,4  \quad \text{ and } \quad q = 1,2, \dots ,Q
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{0,q}&lt;/math&gt; is generally taken to be the duration of the &lt;math&gt;q^{th}&lt;/math&gt; time-history, or the number of points if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

The benefit of expressing the statistical moments in
terms of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is that the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; sets can be combined by
addition, and there is no upper limit on the value of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;
 \gamma_{n,c}= \sum_{q=1}^{Q}\gamma_{n,q} \quad \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=0,1,2,3,4
&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;_c&lt;/math&gt; represents the concatenated
time-history or combined &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. These combined values of
&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can then be inversely transformed into raw moments
representing the complete concatenated time-history

: &lt;math&gt;
 m_{n,c}=\frac{\gamma_{n,c}}{\gamma_{0,c}} \quad \textrm{for} \quad n=1,2,3,4
&lt;/math&gt;

Known relationships between the raw moments (&lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the central moments  (&lt;math&gt; \theta_n = E[(x-\mu)^n])&lt;/math&gt;)
are then used to compute the central moments of the concatenated time-history.  Finally, the statistical moments of the concatenated history are computed from the central moments:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \mu_c=m_{1,c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \sigma^2_c=\theta_{2,c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{3,c}=\frac{\theta_{3,c}}{\sigma_c^3}
 \ \ \ \ \ \alpha_{4,c}=\frac{\theta_{4,c}}{\sigma_c^4}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Covariance==
Very similar algorithms can be used to compute the covariance.  The naive algorithm is:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i)/n}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

For the algorithm above, one could use the following pseudocode:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def naive_covariance(data1, data2):
    n = len(data1)
    sum12 = 0
    sum1 = sum(data1)
    sum2 = sum(data2)

    for i in range(n):
        sum12 += data1[i]*data2[i]

        covariance = (sum12 - sum1*sum2 / n) / n
    return covariance
&lt;/source&gt;

A more numerically stable two-pass algorithm first computes the sample means, and then the covariance:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar y = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n y_i/n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{n}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The two-pass algorithm may be written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def two_pass_covariance(data1, data2):
    n = len(data1)

    mean1 = sum(data1) / n
    mean2 = sum(data2) / n	

    covariance = 0

    for i in range(n):
        a = data1[i] - mean1		
        b = data2[i] - mean2
        covariance += a*b / n

    return covariance
&lt;/source&gt;

A slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals.  The final sums &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum y_i&lt;/math&gt; ''should'' be zero, but the second pass compensates for any small error.

A stable one-pass algorithm exists, similar to the one above, that computes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle C_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x_n)(y_i - \bar y_n)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x_n = \bar x_{n-1} + \frac{x_n - \bar x_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar y_n = \bar y_{n-1} + \frac{y_n - \bar y_{n-1}}{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_n = C_{n-1} + (x_n - \bar x_n)(y_n - \bar y_{n-1}) = C_{n-1} + (y_n - \bar y_n)(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
The apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (x_n - \bar x_n) = \frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;, so both update terms are equal to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \bar x_{n-1})(y_n - \bar y_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;.  Even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means, then using the stable one-pass algorithm on the residuals.

Likewise, there is a formula for combining the covariances of two sets that can be used to parallelize the computation:
:&lt;math&gt;C_X = C_A + C_B + (\bar x_A - \bar x_B)(\bar y_A - \bar y_B)\cdot\frac{n_A n_B}{n_X}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Modulation techniques}}
'''Amplitude modulation''' ('''AM''') is a technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a [[radio]] [[carrier wave]]. AM works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in relation to the information being sent. For example, changes in signal strength may be used to specify the sounds to be reproduced by a [[loudspeaker]], or the light intensity of television pixels. Contrast this with [[frequency modulation]], in which the [[frequency]] is varied, and [[phase modulation]], in which the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied.

In the mid-1870s, a form of amplitude modulation&amp;mdash;initially called &quot;undulatory currents&quot;&amp;mdash;was the first method to successfully produce quality audio over telephone lines. Beginning with [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s audio demonstrations in 1906, it was also the original method used for audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today by many forms of communication&amp;mdash;&quot;AM&quot; is often used to refer to the [[mediumwave]] broadcast [[band (radio)|band]] (see [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]]).

[[Image:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1: An audio signal (top) may be carried by an AM or [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio wave.|alt=Animation of audio, AM and FM sine waves]]

==Forms of amplitude modulation==

In radio communication, a [[continuous wave]] radio-frequency signal (a [[sinusoid]]al [[carrier wave]]) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission. The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the [[Envelope (waves)|''envelope'']] of the waveform. In the [[frequency domain]], amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent [[sideband]]s. Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. Amplitude modulation resulting in two sidebands and a carrier is called &quot;double-sideband amplitude modulation&quot; (DSB-AM). Amplitude modulation is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal, which carries no useful information (beyond the fact that a signal is present).

To increase transmitter efficiency, the carrier may be suppressed. This produces a [[reduced-carrier transmission]], or DSB [[Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|&quot;double-sideband suppressed-carrier&quot; (DSB-SC)]] signal.  A suppressed-carrier AM signal is three times more power-efficient than AM. If the carrier is only partially suppressed, a double-sideband reduced-carrier (DSBRC) signal results.  For reception, a local oscillator will typically restore the suppressed carrier so the signal can be demodulated with a [[product detector]].

Improved bandwidth efficiency is achieved at the expense of increased transmitter and receiver complexity by completely suppressing both the carrier and one of the sidebands. This is [[single-sideband modulation]], widely used in [[amateur radio]] and other communications applications. A simple form of AM, often used for [[digital]] communications, is [[on-off keying]]: a type of ''[[amplitude-shift keying]]'' in which [[Binary numeral system|binary]] data is represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. This is used by radio amateurs to transmit [[Morse code]] and is known as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation.

===ITU designations===

In 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:

==Example: double-sideband AM==
[[Image:AM spectrum.svg|thumb|400px|Fig 2: Double-sided spectra of baseband and AM signals.|alt=Diagrams of an AM signal, with formulas]]

A carrier wave is modeled as a sine wave:

:&lt;math&gt;c(t) = A\cdot \sin(\omega_c t + \phi_c),\,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the frequency in [[Hertz|Hz]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c / (2\pi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The constants &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_c\,&lt;/math&gt; represent the carrier amplitude and initial phase, and are introduced for generality. For simplicity, their respective values can be set to 1 and 0.

Let ''m''(''t'') represent an arbitrary waveform that is the message to be transmitted, and let the constant ''M'' represent its largest magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt;m(t) = M\cdot \cos(\omega_m t + \phi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The message might be just a simple audio tone of frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_m / (2\pi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is assumed that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\omega_m \ll \omega_c\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\min[ m(t) ] = -M.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Amplitude modulation is formed by the product:

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= [1 + m(t)]\cdot c(t),\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= A\cdot[1 + M\cdot \cos(\omega_m t + \phi)]\cdot \sin(\omega_c t).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; represents the carrier amplitude, which is a constant that demonstrates the modulation index. The values ''A''=1 and ''M''=0.5 produce ''y'' (''t''), depicted by the top graph (labelled &quot;50% Modulation&quot;) in Figure 4.
Using [[Trigonometric_identity|trigonometric identities]], ''y''(''t'') can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = A\cdot \sin(\omega_c t) + \begin{matrix}\frac{AM}{2} \end{matrix} \left[\sin((\omega_c + \omega_m) t + \phi) + \sin((\omega_c - \omega_m) t - \phi)\right].\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the modulated signal has three components: a carrier wave and two sinusoidal waves (known as [[sideband]]s), whose frequencies are slightly above and below &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\omega_c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Spectrum===
For more general forms of ''m''(''t''), trigonometry is not sufficient; however, if the top trace of Figure 2 depicts the frequency of ''m''(''t'') the bottom trace depicts the modulated carrier. It has two components: one at a positive [[frequency]] (centered on &lt;math&gt;+\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;) and one at a [[negative frequency]] (centered on &lt;math&gt;-\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;). Each component contains the two sidebands and a narrow segment in between, representing energy at the carrier frequency. Since the negative frequency is a mathematical artifact, examining the positive frequency demonstrates that an AM signal's spectrum consists of its original (two-sided) spectrum, shifted to the carrier frequency. Figure 2 is a result of computing the [[Fourier transform]] of: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;[A + m(t)]\cdot \sin(\omega_c t),\,&lt;/math&gt; using the following transform pairs:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
                   m(t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad M(\omega) \\
       \sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad i \pi \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)] \\
A\cdot \sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad i \pi A \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)] \\
m(t)\cdot A\sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp; \frac{A}{2\pi}\cdot \{M(\omega)\} * \{i \pi \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)]\} \\
=&amp; \frac{iA}{2}\cdot [M(\omega +\omega_c) - M(\omega -\omega_c)]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fig 3: The [[spectrogram]] of an AM broadcast shows its two sidebands (green), separated by the carrier signal (red).|alt=Sonogram of an AM signal, showing the carrier and both sidebands vertically]]

===Power and spectrum efficiency===
In terms of positive frequencies, the transmission bandwidth of AM is twice the signal's original ([[baseband]]) bandwidth; both the positive and negative sidebands are shifted up to the carrier frequency. Thus, double-sideband AM (DSB-AM) is spectrally inefficient since fewer radio stations can be accommodated in a given broadcast band. The suppression methods described above may be understood in terms of Figure 2. With the carrier suppressed, there would be no energy at the center of a group; with a sideband suppressed, the &quot;group&quot; would have the same bandwidth as the positive frequencies of &lt;math&gt;M(\omega).\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; The transmitter-power efficiency of DSB-AM is relatively poor (about 33 percent). The benefit of this system is that receivers are cheaper to produce. Suppressed-carrier AM is 100 percent power-efficient, since no power is wasted on the carrier signal (which conveys no information).

==Modulation index==
The AM modulation index is the measure of the amplitude variation surrounding an unmodulated carrier. As with other modulation indices, in AM this quantity (also called &quot;modulation depth&quot;) indicates how much the modulation varies around its &quot;original&quot; level. For AM, it relates to variations in carrier amplitude and is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\mathrm{peak\ value\ of\ } m(t)}{A} = \frac{M}{A},&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; are the message amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively.

So if &lt;math&gt;h=0.5&lt;/math&gt;, carrier amplitude varies by 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level; for &lt;math&gt;h=1.0&lt;/math&gt;, it varies by 100%. To avoid distortion, modulation depth must not exceed 100 percent. Transmitter systems will usually incorporate a [[limiter]] circuit (such as a [[vogad]]) to ensure this. However, AM demodulators can be designed to detect the inversion (or 180-degree phase reversal) that occurs when modulation exceeds 100 percent; they automatically correct for this defect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Variations of a modulated signal with percentages of modulation are shown below. In each image, the maximum amplitude is higher than in the previous image (note that the scale changes from one image to the next).

Modulation circuit designs may be classified as low- or high-level (depending on whether they modulate in a low-power domain—followed by amplification for transmission—or in the high-power domain of the transmitted signal).&lt;ref&gt;

===Low-level generation===
In modern radio systems, modulated signals are generated via [[digital signal processing]] (DSP). With DSP many types of AM modulation are possible with software control (including DSB with carrier, SSB suppressed-carrier and independent sideband, or ISB). Calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a [[digital to analog converter]], typically at a frequency less than the desired RF-output frequency. The analog signal must then be shifted in frequency, and [[linear amplifier|linearly amplified]] to the desired frequency and power level (linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion).&lt;ref&gt;

AM may also be generated at a low level, using analog methods described in the next section.

===High-level generation===
High-power AM [[transmitter]]s (such as those used for [[AM broadcasting]]) are based on high-efficiency class-D and class-E [[Electronic amplifier|power amplifier]] stages, modulated by varying the supply voltage.&lt;ref&gt;

Older designs (for broadcast and amateur radio) also generate AM by controlling the transmitter’s final amplifier (generally a class-C, for efficiency) gain. The following types are for vacuum tube transmitters (but similar options are available with transistors):&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Plate modulation:''' In plate modulation, the plate voltage of the RF amplifier is modulated with the audio signal. The audio power requirement is 50 percent of the RF-carrier power.
* '''Heising (constant-current) modulation:''' RF amplifier plate voltage is fed through a [[Choke (electronics)|“choke”]] (high-value inductor). The AM modulation tube plate is fed through the same inductor, so the modulator tube diverts current from the RF amplifier. The choke acts as a constant current source in the audio range. This system has a low power efficiency.
* '''Control grid modulation:''' The operating bias and gain of the final RF amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but care must be taken to reduce distortion.
* '''Clamp tube (screen grid) modulation:''' The screen-grid bias may be controlled through a “clamp tube”, which reduces voltage according to the modulation signal. It is difficult to approach 100-percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system.

=={{anchor|AM demodulation methods}}Demodulation methods==
The simplest form of AM demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as [[envelope detector]].  Another type of demodulator, the [[product detector]], can provide better-quality demodulation with additional circuit complexity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic number''' is a number that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently—by clearing denominators—with [[integer]] coefficients). Numbers such as [[pi|π]] that are not algebraic are said to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]; [[almost all]] real and complex numbers are transcendental. (Here &quot;almost all&quot; has the sense &quot;all but a [[countable set]]&quot;; see Properties below.)

==Examples==
*The [[rational number]]s, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'', ''b'' not equal to zero, satisfy the above definition because &lt;math&gt;x = a/b&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;bx-a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972:159-160 and pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic &lt;math&gt;(a = 1)&lt;/math&gt; then the roots are [[quadratic integer]]s.

* The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass and their opposites. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots.  (Note that by designating cardinal directions for 1, -1, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;, complex numbers such as &lt;math&gt;3+\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt; are considered constructible.) 

* Any expression formed using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|''n''th roots]] gives an algebraic number.

* Polynomial roots that can''not'' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of ''n''th roots (such as the roots of &lt;math&gt;x^5 - x + 1 &lt;/math&gt;). This [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.

* [[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; where both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are integers are also quadratic integers.

* [[Trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (except when undefined). For example, each of cos(&lt;math&gt;\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;), cos(&lt;math&gt;3\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;), cos(&lt;math&gt;5\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;) satisfies &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, tan(&lt;math&gt;3\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;7\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;11\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;15\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;) all satisfy the irreducible polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4 - 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].

*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:
** The numbers &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{3}/2&lt;/math&gt; are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
** The [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
** The numbers [[Pi|&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to &quot;produce as many examples of transcendentals numbers as we please,&quot; cf Hardy and Wright p. 161ff&lt;/ref&gt; hence they are transcendental.

==Properties==
[[File:Algebraicszoom.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers coloured by degree. (red=1, green=2, blue=3, yellow=4)]]
* The set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] (enumerable).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1972:160&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hence, the set of algebraic numbers has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero (as a subset of the complex numbers), i.e. &quot;[[Almost everywhere|almost all]]&quot; complex numbers are not algebraic.
* Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the algebraic number is said to be of ''degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''. An algebraic number of degree 1 is a [[rational number]].
* All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]].
* The set of real algebraic numbers is [[linearly ordered]], countable, [[densely ordered]], and without first or last element, so is [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers.

==The field of algebraic numbers==
The sum, difference, product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], sometimes denoted by '''A''' (which may also denote the [[adele ring]]) or &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/span&gt;. Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

==Related fields==
===Numbers defined by radicals===
All numbers which can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of integer [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking ''n''th roots (where ''n'' is a positive integer) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers which cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are solutions to polynomials of degree ≥&amp;nbsp;5. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of polynomial {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x'' &amp;minus; 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).

===Closed-form number===
{{Main|Closed-form number}}
Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to &quot;[[closed-form number]]s&quot;, which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called &quot;elementary numbers&quot;, and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as ''e'' or log(2).

==Algebraic integers==
{{Main|algebraic integer}}
[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers coloured by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer).]]
An '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number which is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{nowrap|1=5 + 13√2}}, {{nowrap|1=2 &amp;minus; ''6''i}}, and {{nowrap|1=½(1 + ''i''√3).}} (Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;minus; ''k''}} for all {{nowrap|1=''k'' &amp;isin; '''Z'''.)}}

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers which are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If ''K'' is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in ''K'', and is frequently denoted as ''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''.
These are the prototypical examples of [[Dedekind domain]]s.

      <sha1>r94iqudcuddecrak9z94h83aujl9zw1</sha1>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

==Definition==
The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of &quot;mathematical object&quot; in question and what, precisely, constitutes an &quot;isomorphism&quot; of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.

In category theory, an automorphism is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e. a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[Category theory#Properties of morphisms|isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

In the context of [[abstract algebra]], for example, a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An isomorphism is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]]. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example: [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).

The [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.

==Automorphism group==
If the automorphisms of an object ''X'' form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of ''X''. That this is indeed a group is simple to see:
* [[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: composition of two endomorphisms is another endomorphism.
* [[Associativity]]: composition of morphisms is ''always'' associative.
* [[Identity element|Identity]]: the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself which exists by definition.
* [[Inverse element|Inverses]]: by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.

==Examples==
* In [[set theory]], an automorphism of a set ''X'' is an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of ''X''. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.
* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.
* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.&lt;ref name=Pahl&gt;

{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&amp;pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=§7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translation |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3-540-67995-2 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').
* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many &quot;wild&quot; automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | month = May | year = 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.
* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.
* For relations, see [[Isomorphism#A relation-preserving isomorphism|relation-preserving automorphism]].
** In [[order theory]], see [[order automorphism]].
* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:
** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].
** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a bijective [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.
** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').
** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.

==History==
One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[Icosian Calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{quotation|so that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by relations of perfect reciprocity.}}

==Inner and outer automorphisms==
In some categories—notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation φ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''G''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''G'' given by &lt;math&gt; \varphi_a (g) = a g a^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; (or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''); this is called [[Goursat's lemma]].

The other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] Aut(''G'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Inn(''G'') is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.

In [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is '''antisymmetric''' if, for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X''
:if ''R(a,b)'' and ''R(b,a)'', then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'',
or, equivalently,
:if ''R(a,b)'' with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''b'', then ''R(b,a)'' must not hold.

In [[mathematical notation]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ R(a,b) \and R(b,a) \; \Rightarrow \; a = b&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

&lt;!-- this is the same formula as above, but due to the addition of the negation, it is more clear where the term anti-symmetric comes from --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ R(a,b) \and a \ne b \Rightarrow \lnot  R(b,a) .&lt;/math&gt;

The usual [[order relation]] ≤ on the [[real number]]s is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in ''A'' also is in ''B'' and every element in ''B'' is also in ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:
:&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \and B \subseteq A \Rightarrow A = B&lt;/math&gt;

[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and antisymmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the &quot;preys on&quot; relation on biological [[species]]).

Antisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]].  According to one definition of '''asymmetric''', anything that fails to be symmetric is asymmetric.  Another definition of '''asymmetric''' makes asymmetry equivalent to antisymmetry plus [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].

==Examples==
The relation &quot;''x'' is even, ''y'' is odd&quot; between a pair (''x'', ''y'') of [[integer]]s is antisymmetric:
:::[[Image:Evenandodd.PNG]]
The [[divisibility]] order of the [[natural number]]s is another example of an antisymmetric relation.

[[Image:Angle Symbol.svg|120px|thumb|right|∠, the angle symbol in [[Unicode]] is [[List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references|U+2220]]]]

In [[geometry]], an '''angle''' is the figure formed by two [[Ray (geometry)|rays]], called the '''sides''' of the angle, sharing a common [[endpoint]], called the '''[[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]''' of the angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM|id=Angle&amp;oldid=13323|title=Angle|year=2001|last=Sidorov|first=L.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Angles are usually presumed to be in a [[Euclidean plane]], but are also defined in [[non-Euclidean geometry]].

'''Angle''' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] by its radius. In the case of an angle (figure), the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any point and its image by the rotation.

The word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning &quot;a corner&quot;. The word ''angulus'' is a diminutive, of which the primitive form, ''angus'', does not occur in Latin. [[Cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀγκύλος}} ''(ankylοs)'', meaning &quot;crooked, curved,&quot; and the [[English language|English]] word &quot;[[ankle]]&quot;. Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning &quot;to bend&quot; or &quot;bow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Slocum|first=Jonathan|year=2007

&lt;!--Note: ἀγκύλος rather than ἀνκύλος is correct, the γκ is a digraph pronounced [ŋk].--&gt;

[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.--&gt;

==Measuring angles==&lt;!-- linked from [[Degree (angle)]] --&gt;
The size of an angle is characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are called congruent angles.

In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full [[turn (geometry)|turn]] are not equivalent.

[[Image:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; is the quotient of &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;.]]

In order to measure an angle &lt;var&gt;[[theta|θ]]&lt;/var&gt;, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The length of the arc &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; is then divided by the radius of the arc &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;, and possibly multiplied by a scaling constant &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; (which depends on the units of measurement that are chosen):

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = k \frac{s}{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered.

===Units===
Units used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].

Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.  For example, in the case of degrees, {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 360.}} A ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = ''n''/(2π)}} in the formula above. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = θ''r''/''s''.}} One [[Turn (geometry)|turn]], for which {{nowrap|1= θ = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2π''r'', so {{nowrap|1= ''s'' = 2π''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for θ and 2π''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = ''nr''/(2π''r'') = ''n''/(2π).}})

*The '''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''' (or '''full circle''', '''revolution''', '''rotation''', or '''cycle''') is one full circle. A ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'' can be subdivided in centiturns and milliturns. A turn is abbreviated &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; or ''rev'' or ''rot'' depending on the application, but just ''r'' in ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute). 1 ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'' = 360° = 2''π'' rad  = 400 grad = 4 right angles.
*The ''quadrant'' is 1/4 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]], i.e. a '''[[right angle]]'''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90° = ''π''/2&amp;nbsp;rad = 1/4 turn = 100&amp;nbsp;grad. In German the symbol &lt;sup&gt;∟&lt;/sup&gt; has been used to denote a quadrant.
*The '''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]''' is 1/6 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonia]]ns{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60° = ''π''/3&amp;nbsp;rad ≈ 1.047197551&amp;nbsp;rad.
[[Image:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; rad = 1 rad.]]
*The '''[[radian]]''' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius (&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; = 1 in the formula given earlier). One [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] is 2''π'' radians, and one radian is 180/''π'' degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and &quot;natural&quot; properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.
*The '''diameter part''' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is 1/60 radian. One &quot;diameter part&quot; is approximately 0.95493°.
*The astronomical '''[[hour angle]]''' is 1/24 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]. Since this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called '''minute of time''' and '''second of time'''.  Note that these are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&amp;nbsp;hour = 15° = ''π''/12&amp;nbsp;rad = 1/6&amp;nbsp;quad. = 1/24 ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'' ≈ 16.667&amp;nbsp;grad.
*The '''[[compass point|point]]''', used in [[navigation]], is 1/32 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]. 1&amp;nbsp;point = 1/8 of a right angle = 11.25° = 12.5&amp;nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] equals 128 quarter-points.
*[[Eratosthenes]] used a unit of 6° so that a whole [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] was divided in 60 units.
*The [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] sometimes used the unit pechus of about 2° or 2½°.
*The '''binary degree''', also known as the '''[[binary radian]]''' (or '''brad'''), is 1/256 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm ooPIC Programmer's Guide (archived)] ''www.oopic.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; equal parts for other values of ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic] Shawn Hargreaves ''blogs.msdn.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''[[degree (angle)|degree]]''', denoted by a small superscript circle (°), is 1/360 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]], so one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'' is 360°. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5° for three and a half degrees), but the &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;second&quot; sexagesimal subunits of the &quot;degree-minute-second&quot; system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]]:
*The '''[[grad (angle)|grad]]''', also called '''grade''', '''gradian''', or '''gon''', is 1/400 of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].
*The '''[[angular mil|mil]]''' is ''approximately'' equal to a [[milliradian]]. There are several definitions ranging from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes), with the milliradian being approximately 0.05729578 degrees (3.43775 minutes).  In [[NATO]] countries, it is defined as 1/6400th of a circle.  Its value is approximately equal to the angle subtended by a width of 1 metre as seen from 1&amp;nbsp;km away (2π / 6400 = 0.0009817… ≒ 1/1000).
* The '''[[minute of arc]]''' (or '''MOA''', '''arcminute''', or just '''minute''') is 1/60 of a degree = 1/21600 [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]. It is denoted by a single prime (&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;). For example, 3°&amp;nbsp;30′ is equal to 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;30/60 degrees, or 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3°&amp;nbsp;5.72′ = 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5.72/60 degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.
* The '''[[second of arc]]''' (or '''arcsecond''', or just '''second''') is 1/60 of a minute of arc and 1/3600 of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&amp;nbsp;″&amp;nbsp;). For example, 3°&amp;nbsp;7′&amp;nbsp;30″ is equal to 3 + 7/60 + 30/3600 degrees, or 3.125&amp;nbsp;degrees.

===Positive and negative angles===
Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference.

In a two dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], angles are typically defined relative to the positive [[x-axis]] with positive angles representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented as they commonly are, with the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are [[counterclockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].

In many contexts, an angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of &quot;one full turn minus ''θ''&quot;. For example, an orientation represented as &amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° or 315°.  However, a rotation of &amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° would not be the same as a rotation of 315°.

In three dimensional geometry, &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;counterclockwise&quot; have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angle are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.

===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===
There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the corresponding angle of rotation.
The '''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]''', or '''gradient''' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes the [[sine]]. Gradients are often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of an angle in radians.

In [[rational geometry]] the ''spread'' between two lines is defined at the square of sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value of the spread between the lines.

===Astronomical approximations===
Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.
* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.
* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.
* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.

These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough approximations only.

==Identifying angles==
In mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (&lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;β&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;φ&lt;/var&gt;, ...) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol [[Pi|π]] is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case roman letters (a, b, c, ...) are also used. See the figures in this article for examples.

In geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted ∠BAC or BÂC. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (&quot;angle A&quot;).

Potentially, an angle denoted, say, ∠BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that ∠BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and ∠CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.

*An angle equal to 1/4 turn (90° or ''[[pi|π]]''/2 radians) is called a '''[[right angle]]'''.
*:Two lines that form a right angle are said to be '''[[perpendicular]]''' or '''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]'''.
*Angles equal to 1/2 turn (180° or two right angles) are called '''straight angles'''.
*Angles equal to 1 turn (360° or four right angles) are called '''full angles'''.
*Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called '''oblique angles'''.
*Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) are called '''acute angles''' (&quot;acute&quot; meaning &quot;sharp&quot;).
*Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) are called '''obtuse angles''' (&quot;obtuse&quot; meaning &quot;blunt&quot;).
*Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) are called '''reflex angles'''.
*Angles that have the same measure (i.e. the same magnitude) are said to be '''equal''' ''(UK)'' or '''[[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]''''' (USA)''. An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are ''congruent'').
*Two angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an &quot;X&quot;-like shape, are called '''[[Vertical (angles)|vertical angles]]''' or '''opposite angles''' or '''vertically opposite angles'''. These angles are equal in measure.

*:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the '''complement''' of the angle.
*Two angles that sum to a straight angle (180°) are called '''[[supplementary angle]]s'''.
*:The difference between an angle and a straight angle (180°) is termed the '''supplement''' of the angle.
*Two angles that sum to one turn (360°) are called '''[[explementary angle]]s''' or '''conjugate angles'''.
*An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an '''[[interior angle]]''' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A [[Convex and concave polygons|concave]] simple polygon has at least one interior angle that exceeds 180°.
*:In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to ''π'' radians, or 180°, or 1/2 turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2''π'' radians, or 360°, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a [[polygon|simple polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to [(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''π''] radians, or [(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;180]°, or (''2n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4) right angles, or (''n/2''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) turn.
*The angle supplementary to the interior angle is called the '''[[exterior angle]]'''. It measures the amount of rotation one has to make at this vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.
*:In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple polygon will be one full turn (360°).
*Some authors use the name '''exterior angle''' of a simple polygon to simply mean the explementary (''not'' supplementary!) of the interior angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |urlname=ExteriorAngle |title=Exterior Angle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflicts with the above usage.
*The angle between two [[Plane (mathematics)|planes]] (such as two adjacent faces of a [[polyhedron]]) is called a '''[[dihedral angle]]'''. It may be defined as the acute angle between two lines [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the planes.
*The angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is equal to ninety degrees minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is normal to the plane.
*Alternate angles, corresponding angle, interior angles and exterior angles are associated with a [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] of a pair of lines by a third.
*A '''reference angle''' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding 180 degrees, and subtracting the result from 180 degrees if necessary, until a value between 0 degrees and 90 degrees is obtained. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180-150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750-720).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angles between curves==
[[Image:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at P is defined as the angle between the tangents &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; at &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;]]
The angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. ''{{lang|grc|ἀμφί}}'', on both sides, ''κυρτός'', convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. ''κισσός'', ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. ''ξυστρίς'', a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. ''κοίλη'', a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. --&gt;

==Dot product and generalisation==
In the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]], the angle θ between two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.

==Inner product==
To define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''·''' ) by the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

In a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle) = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

or, more commonly, using the absolute value, with

:&lt;math&gt; |\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle| = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

The latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span}(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span}(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; spanned by the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; correspondingly.

==Angles between subspaces==
The definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span}(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span}(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; |\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle| = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|&lt;/math&gt;

in a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{U}):=k\leq \operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{W}):=l&lt;/math&gt;, this leads to a definition of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.

==Angles in Riemannian geometry==
In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \theta = \frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}
{\sqrt{ \left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \right| \left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \right|}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Angles in geography and astronomy==
In [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a '''[[geographic coordinate system]]'''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.

In [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several '''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]''', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the '''angular separation''' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.

Astronomers also measure the '''apparent size''' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5°, when viewed from Earth. One could say, &quot;The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.&quot; The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.

An '''atomic orbital''' is a [[mathematical function]] that describes the wave-like behavior of either one [[electron]] or a pair of electrons in an [[atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Milton|last1= Orchin|first2=Roger S.|last2=Macomber|first3=Allan|last3= Pinhas|first4= R.

The term may also refer to the physical region where the electron can be calculated to be, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daintith|first= J. |title=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Atomic orbitals are typically categorized by ''n'', ''l'', and ''m'' [[quantum numbers]], which correspond to the electron's [[energy]], [[angular momentum]], and an angular momentum [[vector component]], respectively. Each orbital is defined by a different set of quantum numbers and contains a maximum of two electrons. The simple names '''s orbital''', '''p orbital''', '''d orbital''' and '''f orbital''' refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number ''l'' = 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. These names indicate the orbital shape and are used to describe the [[electron configuration]]s. They are derived from the characteristics of their spectroscopic lines: '''s'''harp, '''p'''rincipal, '''d'''iffuse, and '''f'''undamental, the rest being named in alphabetical order (omitting&amp;nbsp;j).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the '''atomic orbital model''' (alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model), a modern framework for visualizing the microscopic behavior of electrons in matter. In this model the electron cloud of a multi-electron atom may be seen as being built up (in approximation) in an [[electron configuration]] that is a product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. The repeating ''periodicity'' of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements within sections of the [[periodic table]] arises naturally from the total number of electrons which occupy a complete set of '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' atomic orbitals, respectively.

== Introduction ==

With the development of quantum mechanics, it was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but needed to be explained by the wave-particle duality. In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:

Wave-like properties:
# The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as standing waves. The lowest possible energy an electron can take is therefore analogous to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a string. Higher energy states are then similar to [[harmonics]] of the [[fundamental frequency]].
# The electrons are never in a single point location, although the probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be found from the wave function of the electron.

Particle-like properties:
# There is always an integer number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.
# Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon.
# The electrons retain particle like-properties such as: each wave state has the same electrical charge as the electron particle. Each wave state has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down).

Thus, despite the obvious analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described as solid particles. In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly-shaped &quot;atmosphere&quot; (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this &quot;atmosphere&quot; only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom’s “electron cloud” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics -The Definitive Edition, Vol 1 lect 6| page=11| year=2006| publisher= Pearson PLC, Addison Wesley|isbn =0-8053-9046-4|last1= Feynman|first1= Richard|last2= Leighton |first2=Robert B. |first3= Matthew |last3=Sands
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing where the atom’s electrons will be found.

===Formal quantum mechanical definition===

Atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e. an [[eigenstate]] of the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], is approximated by an expansion (see [[configuration interaction]] expansion and [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]) into [[linear combination]]s of anti-symmetrized products ([[Slater determinant]]s) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called '''atomic orbitals'''. (When one considers also their [[spin (physics)|spin]] component, one speaks of '''atomic spin orbitals'''.)  A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this [[Nuclear structure#The independent-particle model|independent-particle model]] of products of single electron wave functions.  &lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], ''[[The Road to Reality]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[London dispersion force]], for example, depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons.)

In [[atomic physics]], the [[atomic spectral line]]s correspond to transitions ([[Atomic electron transition|quantum leap]]s) between [[quantum state]]s of an atom. These states are labeled by a set of [[quantum number]]s summarized in the [[term symbol]] and usually associated with particular electron configurations, i.e., by occupation schemes of '''atomic orbitals''' (e.g., 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; for the ground state of [[neon]] -- term symbol: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

This notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the [[configuration interaction]] expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given [[Atomic electron transition|transition]]. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that electrons are [[fermion]]s ruled by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when [[electron correlation]] is large.

Fundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital vision which (even if it is not spelled out) is heavily influenced by this [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] approximation, which is one way to reduce the complexities of [[molecular orbital theory]].

===Types of orbitals===

Atomic orbitals can be the hydrogen-like &quot;orbitals&quot; which are exact solutions to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for a [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like &quot;atom&quot;]] (i.e., an atom with one electron). Alternatively, atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron (i.e. orbitals) but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule. The [[coordinate system]]s chosen for atomic orbitals are usually [[spherical coordinates]] (r,θ,φ) in atoms and [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesians]] (x,y,z) in poly-atomic molecules. The advantage of spherical coordinates (for atoms) is that an orbital wave function is a product of three factors each dependent on a single coordinate: ψ(r,θ,φ) = R(r) Θ(θ) Φ(φ).

The angular factors of atomic orbitals Θ(θ) Φ(φ) generate s, p, d, etc. functions as [[Spherical harmonics#Real form|real combinations]] of [[spherical harmonics]] Y&lt;sub&gt;lm&lt;/sub&gt;(θ, φ) (where l and m are quantum numbers). There are typically three mathematical forms for the radial functions R(r) which can be chosen as a starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules with many electrons. 

# the [[Atomic Orbital#Hydrogen-like orbitals|hydrogen-like atomic orbitals]] are derived from the exact solution of the Schrödinger Equation for one electron and a nucleus. The part of the function that depends on the distance from the nucleus has nodes (radial nodes) and decays as e&lt;sup&gt;(-distance)&lt;/sup&gt; from the nucleus.
# The [[Slater-type orbital]] (STO) is a form without radial nodes but  decays from the nucleus as does the hydrogen-like orbital.
# The form of the [[Gaussian orbital|Gaussian type orbital]] (Gaussians) has no radial nodes and decays as e&lt;sup&gt;(-distance squared)&lt;/sup&gt;.

Although hydrogen-like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools, the advent of computers has made STOs preferable for atoms and diatomic molecules since combinations of STOs can replace the nodes in hydrogen-like atomic orbital. Gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms. Although not as accurate by themselves as STOs, combinations of many Gaussians can attain the accuracy of hydrogen-like orbitals.

===Early models===

With [[J.J. Thomson]]'s discovery of the electron in 1897,&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceC&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first= J. J. |last=Thomson |year=1897|title=Cathode rays|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume= 44|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature, but were rather composite particles. The newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atom's constituent parts might interact with each other. Thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit-like rings within a positively-charged jelly-like substance,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between the electron's discovery and 1909, this &quot;[[plum pudding model]]&quot; was the most widely-accepted explanation of atomic structure.

Shortly after Thomson's discovery, [[Hantaro Nagaoka]], a Japanese physicist, predicted a different model for electronic structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagaoka 1904 445–455&quot;/&gt; Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's &quot;Saturnian Model&quot; was concentrated into a central core, pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings. Few people took notice of Nagaoka's work at the time,&lt;ref&gt;

===Bohr atom===

In 1909 [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that the positive half of atoms was tightly condensed into a nucleus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A | year=1909 | volume=82 | pages=495&amp;ndash;500 | url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/GM-1909.html| doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode = 1909RSPSA..82..495G | issue=557 | last1=Geiger | first1=H. | last2=Marsden | first2=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and it became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure. Shortly after, in 1913, Rutherford's postdoctoral student [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete values of angular momentum, quantized in units h/2π.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohr 1913 476&quot;/&gt; This constraint automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies. The [[Bohr model]] of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state (by declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines.

[[Image:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|The [[Bohr model|Rutherford–Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom.]]
After Bohr's use of Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the [[Emission spectra|emission]] and [[absorption spectra]] of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the [[Bohr model]] was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was, however, ''not'' achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as [[matter waves]] was not suggested until twelve years later. Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.

With [[de Broglie]]'s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924, and for a short time before the full 1926 [[Schrödinger equation]] treatment of [[hydrogen like atom]], a Bohr electron &quot;wavelength&quot; could be seen to be a function of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this historically incorrect Bohr model is still occasionally taught to students). The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.

The Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[hydrogen]]. The energies of electrons in the n=1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that helium (2 electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical behavior. Modern physics explains this by noting that the n=1 state holds 2 electrons, the n=2 state holds 8 electrons, and the n=3 state holds 8 electrons (in argon). In the end, this was solved by the discovery of modern quantum mechanics and the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]].

===Modern conceptions and connections to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle===

Immediately after [[Heisenberg]] discovered his [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| issue=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
it was noted by [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] that the existence of any sort of [[wave packet]] implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Bohr | first=Niels

| issue=3050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus, the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space, increases without bound, as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.  

In chemistry, [[Schrödinger]], [[Pauling]], [[Robert S. Mulliken|Mulliken]] and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. [[Max Born]] suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a [[probability distribution]] which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom. 

In the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schrödinger and others, the Bohr atom number ''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere'' in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.

==Orbital names==
Orbitals are given names in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;X \, \mathrm{type}^y \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is the energy level corresponding to the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', '''type''' is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]] of the orbital and it corresponds to the [[angular quantum number]] ''l'', and ''y'' is the number of electrons in that orbital.

For example, the orbital 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (pronounced &quot;one ess two&quot;) has two electrons and is the lowest energy level (''n'' = 1) and has an angular quantum number of ''l'' = 0. In [[X-ray notation]], the ''principal quantum number'' is given a letter associated with it. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}}, the letters associated with those numbers are ''K'', ''L'', ''M'', ''N'', ''O'', ..., respectively.

==Hydrogen-like orbitals==
{{Main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

The simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a single electron, such as the [[hydrogen atom]]. An atom of any other element [[ion]]ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see [[hydrogen atom]]). 

For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are ''qualitatively'' similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and precise analysis, the numerical approximations must be used.

A given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers: [[Principal quantum number|''n'']], [[Azimuthal quantum number|''l'']], and [[magnetic quantum number|''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'']]. The rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the [[periodic table]].

The stationary states ([[quantum state]]s) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its atomic orbitals.{{Clarify|date=November 2011|hydrogen-like atoms and orbitals}} However, in general, an electron's behavior is not fully described by a single orbital. Electron states are best represented by time-depending &quot;mixtures&quot; ([[linear combination]]s) of multiple orbitals. See [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]].

The quantum number ''n'' first appeared in the [[Bohr model]] where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, ''n'' determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of ''n'' lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of ''n'' are said to comprise a &quot;[[electron shell|shell]]&quot;. Orbitals with the same value of ''n'' and also the same value of ''l'' are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a &quot;[[electron subshell|subshell]]&quot;.

==Quantum numbers==
{{main|Quantum number}}

Because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus, atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum numbers. These quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values, and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed.

===Complex orbitals===

In physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:

The [[principal quantum number]], ''n'', describes the energy of the electron and is always a [[positive integer]]. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called ''[[electron shells]]''.

The [[azimuthal quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where ''n'' is some integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation &lt;math&gt;0 \le \ell \le n_0-1&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the ''n'' = 1 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''n'' = 2 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.

The [[magnetic quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt;, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is some integer &lt;math&gt;\ell_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges thus: &lt;math&gt;-\ell_0 \le m_\ell \le \ell_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; available in that subshell. Empty cells represent subshells that do not exist.

Subshells are usually identified by their &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-values. &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its numerical value, but &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's', 1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'. For instance, one may speak of the subshell with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt; as a '2s subshell'.

Each electron also has a [[spin quantum number]], '''s''', which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number '''s''' can be +{{frac|1|2}} or -{{frac|1|2}}.

The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state: every electron in an atom must have a unique combination of quantum numbers.

The above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the ''z'' direction in Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing ''m''=+1 from ''m''=-1. As such, the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries. The [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]] — where an atom is exposed to a magnetic field — provides one such example.&lt;ref&gt;

===Real orbitals===

An atom that is embedded in a crystalline solid feels multiple preferred axes, but no preferred direction. Instead of building atomic orbitals out of the product of radial functions and a single spherical harmonic, linear combinations of spherical harmonics are typically used, designed so that the imaginary part of the spherical harmonics cancel out. These '''real orbitals''' are the building blocks most commonly shown in orbital visualizations.

In the real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, ''n'' and ''l'' have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but ''m'' is no longer a good quantum number (though its absolute value is). The orbitals are given new names based on their shape with respect to a standardized Cartesian basis. The real hydrogen-like ''p'' orbitals are given by the following:

:&lt;math&gt;p_z = p_0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( p_1 + p_{-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_y = \frac{1}{i\sqrt{2}} \left( p_1 - p_{-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n1''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n1''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n1''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1-1&lt;/sub&gt;, are the complex orbitals corresponding to ''l'' = 1.

==Shapes of orbitals==
[[File:HydrogenOrbitalsN6L0M0.png|thumb|Cross-section of computed hydrogen atom orbital (''ψ(r,θ,φ)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the 6s (''n''=6, ''l''=0, ''m''=0) orbital. Note that s orbitals, though spherically symmetrical, have radially placed wave-nodes for ''n'' &gt; 1. However, only s orbitals invariably have a center anti-node; the other types never do.]]
 
Simple pictures showing orbital shapes are intended to describe the angular forms of regions in space where the electrons occupying the orbital are likely to be found. The diagrams cannot, however, show the entire region where an electron can be found, since according to quantum mechanics there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron anywhere in space. Instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or [[contour line|contour surfaces]] where the probability density |ψ(r,θ,φ)|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a constant value, chosen so that there is a certain probability (for example 90%) of finding the electron within the contour. Although |ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the square of an [[absolute value]] is everywhere non-negative, the sign of the [[wave function]] ψ(r,θ,φ) is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture.

Sometimes the ''ψ'' function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the |''ψ(r,θ,φ)''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which shows probability density but has no phases (which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since ''ψ(r,θ,φ)'' is a complex number). |''ψ(r,θ,φ)''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital graphs tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than ''ψ(r,θ,φ)'' graphs, but have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly ''ψ(r,θ,φ)'' graphs.

The lobes can be viewed as [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns between the two counter rotating &quot;''m''&quot; and &quot;''-m''&quot; modes, with the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant &quot;''m''&quot; wavelengths around the circumference. For each ''m'' there are two of these ''&lt;m&gt;+&lt;-m&gt;'' and ''&lt;m&gt;-&lt;-m&gt;''. For the case where m=0 the orbital is vertical, counter rotating information is unknown, and the orbital is z-axis symmetric. For the case where ''l=0'' there are no counter rotating modes.  There are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric.  For any given ''n'', the smaller ''l'' is, the more radial nodes there are.  Loosely speaking ''n'' is energy, ''l'' is analogous to [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and ''m'' is orientation.

Generally speaking, the number ''n'' determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus: as ''n'' increases, the size of the orbital increases. However, in comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge, ''Z'', of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the number of electrons in heavier elements (higher ''Z'') increases.

Also in general terms, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; determines an orbital's shape, and &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; its orientation. However, since some orbitals are described by equations in [[complex number]]s, the shape sometimes depends on &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; also.

The single s-orbitals (&lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;) are shaped like spheres. For ''n'' = 1 the sphere is &quot;solid&quot; (it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for ''n'' = 2 or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the &quot;wave-structure&quot; is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all ''n'' numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node ''at'' the nucleus).

The three p-orbitals for ''n'' = 2 have the form of two [[ellipsoid]]s with a [[point of tangency]] at the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (the two-lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a &quot;[[dumbbell]]&quot;). The three p-orbitals in each [[Electron shell|shell]] are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective linear combination of values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:D orbitals.svg|thumb|250px|The five d orbitals in ''ψ(x,y,z)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; form, with a combination diagram showing how they fit together to fill space around an atomic nucleus.]]
Four of the five d-orbitals for ''n'' = 3 look similar, each with four pear-shaped lobes, each lobe tangent to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane, between a pair of axes. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes, and the fourth has the centres on the x and y axes. The fifth and final d-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a [[torus]] with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis.

There are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-orbitals.

For each s, p, d, f and g set of orbitals, the set of orbitals which composes it forms a spherically symmetrical set of shapes. For non-s orbitals, which have lobes, the lobes point in directions so as to fill space as symmetrically as possible for number of lobes which exist for a set of orientations. For example, the three p orbitals have six lobes which are oriented to each of the six primary directions of 3-D space; for the 5 d orbitals, there are a total of 18 lobes, in which again six point in primary directions, and the 12 additional lobes fill the 12 gaps which exist between each pairs of these 6 primary axes.

Additionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g orbitals with ''n'' values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of ''n'' (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p), an additional node in each lobe. Still higher values of ''n'' further increase the number of radial nodes, for each type of orbital.

The shapes of atomic orbitals in one-electron atom are related to 3-dimensional [[spherical harmonics]]. These shapes are not unique, and any linear combination is valid, like a transformation to [[cubic harmonic]]s, in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the d's are the same shape, just like the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are the same shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ed045p45 | title = The five equivalent d orbitals | year = 1968 | last1 = Powell | first1 = Richard E. | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 45| issue = 1 | page = 45|bibcode = 1968JChEd..45...45P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi =10.1063/1.1750628 | title =Directed Valence | year =1940 | last1 =Kimball | first1 =George E. | journal =The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume =8| issue =2 | page =188|bibcode = 1940JChPh...8..188K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbitals table===
This table shows all orbital configurations for the real hydrogen-like wave functions up to 7s, and therefore covers the simple electronic configuration for all elements in the periodic table up to [[radium]]. ''ψ'' graphs are shown with '''-''' and '''+''' [[wave function]] phases shown in two different colors (arbitrarily red and blue). The ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is the same as the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, but the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are formed by taking linear
combinations of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''+1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''-1''&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals (which is why they are listed under the m=±1 label). Also, the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''+1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''-1''&lt;/sub&gt; are not
the same shape as the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;, since they are pure [[spherical harmonics]].

===Qualitative understanding of shapes===
The shapes of atomic orbitals can be understood qualitatively by considering the analogous case of [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing waves on a circular drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Cazenave, Lions | first=T., P. 
| title=Orbital stability of standing waves for some nonlinear Schrödinger equations
| journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics | year=1982
| volume=85 | issue=4 | pages= 549–561
|doi = 10.1007/BF01403504 |bibcode = 1982CMaPh..85..549C
| last2=Lions
| first2=P. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and '''momentum''' at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is '''also''' a function of the electron's average '''momentum''' at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends to &quot;localize&quot; the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for details of the mechanism).  

This relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to '''s''' orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the [[antinode]] in all '''s''' orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum. 

A mental &quot;planetary orbit&quot; picture closest to the behavior of electrons in '''s''' orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of the path of an atomic-sized [[black hole]], or some other imaginary particle which is able to fall with increasing velocity from space directly through the Earth, without stopping or being affected by any force but gravity, and in this way falls through the core and out the other side in a straight line, and off again into space, while slowing from the backwards gravitational tug. If such a particle were gravitationally bound to the Earth it would not escape, but would pursue a series of passes in which it always slowed at some maximal distance into space, but had its maximal velocity at the Earth's center (this &quot;orbit&quot; would have an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 1.0). If such a particle also had a wave nature, it would have the highest probability of being located where its velocity and momentum were highest, which would be at the Earth's core. In addition, rather than be confined to an infinitely narrow &quot;orbit&quot; which is a straight line, it would pass through the Earth from all directions, and not have a preferred one. Thus, a &quot;long exposure&quot; photograph of its motion over a very long period of time, would show a sphere. 

In order to be stopped, such a particle would need to interact with the Earth in some way other than gravity. In a similar way, all '''s''' electrons have a finite probability of being found inside the nucleus, and this allows '''s''' electrons to occasionally participate in strictly nuclear-electron interaction processes, such as [[electron capture]] and [[internal conversion]].

Below, a number of drum membrane vibration modes are shown. The analogous wave functions of the hydrogen atom are indicated. A correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate system ''ψ(r,θ)'' and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-coordinate ''ψ(r,θ,φ)''.

&lt;center  | align = center&gt;
'''s-type modes'''
&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
Image:Drum vibration mode01.gif|Mode &lt;math&gt;u_{01}&lt;/math&gt; (1s orbital)
Image:Drum vibration mode02.gif|Mode &lt;math&gt;u_{02}&lt;/math&gt; (2s orbital)
Image:Drum vibration mode03.gif|Mode &lt;math&gt;u_{03}&lt;/math&gt; (3s orbital)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

None of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-'''s''' orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it. 

In addition, the drum modes analogous to '''p''' and '''d''' modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to '''s''' modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-'''s''' orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Orbital energy==
{{main|electron shell}}
In atoms with a single electron ([[hydrogen-like atom]]s), the energy of an orbital (and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined exclusively by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases. For high &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with different &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; within a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are (to a good approximation) degenerate, and have the same energy. [This approximation is broken to a slight extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus, and by [[quantum electrodynamics]] effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for '''s''' electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms. See [[Lamb shift]].]

In atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the [[energy level]]s of orbitals depend not only on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but also on &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;. Higher values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2''p'' state is higher than the 2''s'' state. When &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 2, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the ''s''-orbital in the next higher shell; when &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 3 the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled. 

The increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron-electron interaction effects, and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number, the &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement.

The energy sequence of the first 24 subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; given by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.

''Note: empty cells indicate non-existent sublevels, while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could exist, but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known.''

==Electron placement and the periodic table==
[[Image:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|350px| [[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital|molecular]] orbitals. The chart of orbitals ('''left''') is arranged by increasing energy (see [[Madelung rule]]). ''Note that atomic orbits are functions of three variables (two angles, and the distance from the nucleus, r). These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital, but not entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.'']]

{{main|electron configuration|electron shell}}

Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''[[electron configuration]]''). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as well as [[Spin quantum number|''s'']], or [[spin quantum number]]. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''only'' two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.

Additionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a [[photon]]) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.

This behavior is responsible for the structure of the [[periodic table]]. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th shell. [[Niels Bohr]] was the first to propose (1923) that the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = Niels | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title = Über die Anwendung der Quantumtheorie auf den Atombau. I | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Physik]] | year = 1923 | volume = 13 | page = 117|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...13..117B |doi = 10.1007/BF01328209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular '[[Periodic table block|blocks]]'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state (but the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; associated with that &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state depends upon the period). For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of Li and Be respectively belong to the 2s subshell, and those of Na and Mg to the 3s subshell.

The following is the order for filling the &quot;subshell&quot; orbitals, which also gives the order of the &quot;blocks&quot; in the periodic table:

:'''1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p'''

The &quot;periodic&quot; nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' &quot;blocks&quot;, is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows (&quot;periods&quot;) in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
1s                                    
2s                          2p  2p  2p
3s                          3p  3p  3p
4s      3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p
5s      4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p
6s (4f) 5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p
7s (5f) 6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the [[atomic number]]. The electrons in the outermost shell, or ''[[valence electron]]s'', tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.

===Relativistic effects===
{{Main|Relativistic quantum chemistry}}

For elements with high atomic number Z, the effects of relativity become more pronounced, and especially so for ''s'' electrons, which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high Z atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding ''s'' and ''d'' electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.

Examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding) and the golden color of [[gold]] and [[caesium]] (which results from narrowing of 6s to 5d transition energy to the point that visible light begins to be absorbed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtut/atomic/qprimer/#Q26|title= Primer on Quantum Theory of the Atom|first=Stephen |last=Lower}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Bohr Model]], an &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; electron has a velocity given by &lt;math&gt;v = Z \alpha c&lt;/math&gt;, where ''Z'' is the atomic number, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]], and ''c'' is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, therefore, any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the [[Dirac equation]], which accounts for relativistic effects, the wavefunction of the electron for atoms with '''Z &gt; 137''' is oscillatory and [[unbounded]]. The significance of element 137, also known as [[untriseptium]], was first pointed out by the physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Element 137 is sometimes informally called [[feynmanium]] (symbol Fy). However, Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of Z due to the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons, resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than '''Z'''. The critical '''Z''' value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-positron pairs, does not occur until '''Z''' is about 173. These conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators, where such electron-positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed. See [[Extension of the periodic table beyond the seventh period]].

There are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities, although individual components of the wavefunction will have nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed046p678|title=Contour diagrams for relativistic orbitals|year=1969|last1=Szabo|first1=Attila|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=46|issue=10|pages=678|bibcode = 1969JChEd..46..678S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transitions between orbitals ==
Under quantum mechanics, each quantum state has a well-defined energy. When applied to atomic orbitals, this means that each state has a specific energy, and that if an electron is to move between states, the energy difference is also very fixed.

Consider two states of the Hydrogen atom:

State 1) n=1, l=0, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=0 and s=+{{frac|1|2}}

State 2) n=2, l=0, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=0 and s=+{{frac|1|2}}

By quantum theory, state 1 has a fixed energy of E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and state 2 has a fixed energy of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, what would happen if an electron in state 1 were to move to state 2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value, it cannot jump from state 1 to state 2. Now, suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will be absorbed by the electron in state 1, and that electron will jump to state 2. However, photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.

The atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.

The atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.

[[File:Area.svg|right|thumb|alt=Three shapes on a square grid|The combined area of these three [[shapes]] is between 15 and 16 [[square (geometry)|squares]].]]
'''Area''' is a [[quantity]] that expresses the extent of a [[two-dimensional]] [[surface]] or [[shape]], or [[planar lamina]], in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].  Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of [[paint]] necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.&lt;ref name=MathWorld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Area.html|title=Area|publisher=[[Wolfram MathWorld]]|author=[[Eric W. Weisstein]]|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the two-dimensional [[analog]] of the [[length]] of a [[plane curve|curve]] (a one-dimensional concept) or the [[volume]] of a [[solid geometry|solid]] (a three-dimensional concept).

The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to [[square (geometry)|squares]] of a fixed size.&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;  In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of area is the [[square metre]] (written as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the area of a square whose sides are one [[metre]] long.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] [http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/ Resolution 12 of the 11th meeting of the CGPM (1960)], retrieved 15 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.  In [[mathematics]], the [[unit square]] is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[real number]].

There are several well-known [[formula]]s for the areas of simple shapes such as [[triangle]]s, [[rectangle]]s, and [[circle]]s.  Using these formulas, the area of any [[polygon]] can be found by [[Polygon triangulation|dividing the polygon into triangles]].&lt;ref name=bkos&gt;{{Citation |author1=Mark de Berg |author2=Marc van Kreveld |author3=Mark Overmars |author3-link=Mark Overmars |author4=Otfried Schwarzkopf  |year=2000 |title=Computational Geometry |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |edition=2nd revised |isbn=3-540-65620-0 |chapter=Chapter 3: Polygon Triangulation |pages=45–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For shapes with curved boundary, [[calculus]] is usually required to compute the area.  Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the [[History of calculus|historical development of calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=0-486-60509-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a solid shape such as a [[sphere]], [[Cone (geometry)|cone]], or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], the area of its boundary surface is called the [[surface area]].&lt;ref name=MathWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SurfaceArea.html|title=Surface Area|publisher=[[Wolfram MathWorld]]|author=[[Eric W. Weisstein]]|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires [[multivariable calculus]].

Area plays an important role in modern mathematics.  In addition to its obvious importance in [[geometry]] and calculus, area is related to the definition of [[determinant]]s in [[linear algebra]], and is a basic property of surfaces in [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doCarmo&quot;&gt;do Carmo, Manfredo. Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. Prentice-Hall, 1976. Page 98, ISBN 978-0132125895&lt;/ref&gt; In [[analysis]], the area of a subset of the plane is defined using [[Lebesgue measure]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudin&quot;&gt;Walter Rudin, ''Real and Complex Analysis'', McGraw-Hill, 1966, ISBN 0-07-100276-6.&lt;/ref&gt; though not every subset is measurable.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of [[volume]] for two-dimensional regions.&lt;ref name=MathWorld/&gt;

Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. It can be proved that such a function exists.

==Formal definition==
{{see also|Jordan measure}}
An approach to defining what is meant by area is through [[axioms]]. Area can be defined as a function from a collection M of special kind of plane figures (termed measurable sets) to the set of real numbers which satisfies the following properties:
* For all ''S'' in ''M'', ''a''(''S'') ≥ 0.
* If ''S'' and ''T'' are in ''M'' then so are ''S'' ∪ ''T'' and ''S'' ∩ ''T'', and also ''a''(''S''∪''T'') = ''a''(''S'') + ''a''(''T'') − ''a''(''S''∩''T'').
* If ''S'' and ''T'' are in ''M'' with ''S'' ⊆ ''T'' then ''T'' − ''S'' is in ''M'' and ''a''(''T''−''S'') = ''a''(''T'') − ''a''(''S'').
* If a set ''S'' is in ''M'' and ''S'' is congruent to ''T'' then ''T'' is also in ''M'' and ''a''(''S'') = ''a''(''T'').
* Every rectangle ''R'' is in ''M''. If the rectangle has length ''h'' and breadth ''k'' then ''a''(''R'') = ''hk''.
* Let ''Q'' be a set enclosed between two step regions ''S'' and ''T''. A step region is formed from a finite union of adjacent rectangles resting on a common base, i.e. ''S'' ⊆ ''Q'' ⊆ ''T''. If there is a unique number ''c'' such that ''a''(''S'') ≤ c ≤ ''a''(''T'') for all such step regions ''S'' and ''T'', then ''a''(''Q'') = ''c''.

It can be proved that such an area function actually exists.&lt;ref name=Moise&gt;{{cite book|last=Moise|first=Edwin|title=Elementary Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Elementary_geometry_from_an_advanced_sta.html?id=7nUNAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=15 July 2012|year=1963|publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
[[Image:SquareMeterQuadrat.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A square made of PVC pipe on grass|A square metre [[quadrat]] made of PVC pipe.]]
Every [[unit of length]] has a corresponding unit of area, namely the area of a square with the given side length.  Thus areas can be measured in [[square metre]]s (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), square centimetres (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), square millimetres (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square kilometre]]s (km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square foot|square feet]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square yard]]s (yd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square mile]]s (mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and so forth.&lt;ref name=BIPM2006Ch5/&gt;  Algebraically, these units can be thought of as the [[square (algebra)|squares]] of the corresponding length units.

The SI unit of area is the square metre, which is considered an [[SI derived unit]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

===Conversions===
[[Image:Area conversion - square mm in a square cm.png|thumb|right|320px|alt=A diagram showing the conversion factor between different areas|Although there are 10 mm in 1 cm, there are 100 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
The conversion between two square units is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the conversion between the corresponding length units.  For example, since
:1 [[foot (unit)|foot]] = 12 [[inch]]es,
the relationship between square feet and square inches is
:1 square foot = 144 square inches,
where 144 = 12&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 12 × 12.  Similarly:
* 1 square kilometer = [[million|1,000,000]] square meters
* 1 square meter = [[10000 (number)|10,000]] square centimetres = 1,000,000 square millimetres
* 1 square centimetre = [[100 (number)|100]] square millimetres
* 1 square yard = [[9 (number)|9]] square feet
* 1 square mile = 3,097,600 square yards = 27,878,400 square feet
In addition,
* 1 square inch = 6.4516 square centimetres
* 1 square foot = {{gaps|0.092|903|04}} square metres
* 1 square yard = {{gaps|0.836|127|36}} square metres
* 1 square mile = {{gaps|2.589|988|110|336}} square kilometres

===Other units===
{{See also|Category:Units of area}}
There are several other common units for area.  The &quot;[[Are (unit)|Are]]&quot; was the original unit of area in the [[metric system]], with; 
*1 are = 100 square metres
Though the are has fallen out of use, the [[hectare]] is still commonly used to measure land:&lt;ref name=BIPM2006Ch5&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Bureau international des poids et mesures|year=2006 |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf |title=The International System of Units (SI)|version= 8th ed.|accessdate=2008-02-13}} Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1 hectare = 100 ares = 10,000 square metres = 0.01 square kilometres
Other uncommon metric units of area include the [[tetrad (unit of area)|tetrad]], the [[hectad]], and the [[myriad]].

The [[acre]] is also commonly used to measure land areas, where
*1 acre = 4,840 square yards = 43,560 square feet.
An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare.

On the atomic scale, area is measured in units of [[Barn (unit)|barns]], such that:&lt;ref name=BIPM2006Ch5/&gt;
*1 barn = 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; square meters.
The barn is commonly used in describing the cross sectional area of interaction in [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref name=BIPM2006Ch5/&gt;

In India,

*20 Dhurki = 1 Dhur

*20 Dhur = 1 Khatha

*20 Khata = 1 Bigha

*32 Khata = 1 Acre

==Area formulae==
===Polygon Formulae===
====Rectangles====
[[Image:RectangleLengthWidth.svg|thumb|right|180px|alt=A rectangle with length and width labelled|The area of this rectangle is&amp;nbsp;{{math|''lw''}}.]]
The most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a [[rectangle]].  Given a rectangle with length {{math|''l''}} and {{math|''w''}}, the formula for the area is:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=AF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.com/tables/geometry/areas.htm|title=Area Formulas|publisher=Math.com|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''lw''}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(rectangle)&lt;/big&gt;
That is, the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width.  As a special case, as &lt;math&gt; l = w &lt;/math&gt; in the case of a square, the area of a square with side length {{math|''s''}} is given by the formula:&lt;ref name=MathWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(square)&lt;/big&gt;

The formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area, and is sometimes taken as a [[definition]] or [[axiom]].  On the other hand, if [[geometry]] is developed before [[arithmetic]], this formula can be used to define [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s.

[[Image:ParallelogramArea.svg|thumb|left|180px|alt=A diagram showing how a parallelogram can be re-arranged into the shape of a rectangle|Equal area figures.]]

====Dissection formulae====
Most other simple formulae for area follow from the method of [[dissection (geometry)|dissection]].
This involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must [[addition|sum]] to the area of the original shape.

For an example, any [[parallelogram]] can be subdivided into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], as shown in figure to the left.  If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle.  It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''bh''}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(parallelogram).&lt;/big&gt;
[[Image:TriangleArea.svg|thumb|right|180px|alt=A parallelogram split into two equal triangles|Two equal triangles.]]However, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a [[diagonal]] into two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles, as shown in the figure to the right.  It follows that the area of each triangle is half the area of the parallelogram:&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}bh&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(triangle).&lt;/big&gt;
Similar arguments can be used to find area formulae for the [[trapezoid]] and the [[rhombus]], as well as more complicated [[polygon]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Area of curved shapes===
====Circles====
[[Image:CircleArea.svg|thumb|right|alt=A circle divided into many sectors can be re-arranged roughly to form a parallelogram|A circle can be divided into [[Circular sector|sector]]s which rearrange to form an approximate [[parallelogram]].]]
{{main|Area of a circle}}
The formula for the area of a [[circle]] (more properly called [[area of a disk]]) is based on a similar method.  Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[Circular sector|sector]]s, as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form and approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|π''r''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|''r'' × π''r''}}, or {{math|π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(circle).&lt;/big&gt;
Though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is the area of the circle.&lt;ref name=Surveyor/&gt;

This argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;A \;=\; \int_{-r}^r 2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\,dx \;=\; \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;

====Ellipses====
{{main|Ellipse#Area}}
The formula for the area of an [[ellipse]] is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} the formula is:&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi xy \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Surface area====
{{main|Surface area}}
[[Image:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|180px|alt=A blue sphere inside a cylinder of the same height and radius|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area and volume of a [[sphere]] is exactly 2/3 of the area and volume of the surrounding [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] surface.]]
Most basic formulae for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed.

The formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult to derive: because the surface of a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is:&lt;ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea/&gt;
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} 4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sphere).&lt;/big&gt;
where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]].

===General formulae===
====Areas of 2-dimensional figures====
*A [[triangle]]: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12Bh&lt;/math&gt; (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and &lt;math&gt;s = \tfrac12(a + b + c)&lt;/math&gt; is half of its perimeter.&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 a b \sin(C)&lt;/math&gt; where {{math|''C''}} is the given angle and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are its included sides.&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3)&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points ''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'', ''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'', and ''(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)''. The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[Infinitesimal calculus]] to find the area.
*A [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points: &lt;math&gt;i + \frac{b}{2} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points.&lt;ref name=Pick&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trainin |first=J. |title=An elementary proof of Pick's theorem |journal=[[Mathematical Gazette]] |volume=91 |issue=522 |date=2007-11 |pages=536–540}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is known as [[Pick's theorem]].&lt;ref name=Pick/&gt;

====Area in calculus====

*The area between a positive-valued curve and the horizontal axis, measured between two values ''a'' and ''b'' (b is defined as the larger of the two values) on the horizontal axis, is given by the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of the function that represents the curve:&lt;ref name=MathWorld/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_a^{b} f(x) \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
*The area between the [[graph of a function|graph]]s of two functions is [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] to the [[integral]] of one [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''f''(''x''), [[subtraction|minus]] the integral of the other function, ''g''(''x''):
:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_a^{b}  ( f(x) - g(x) ) \, dx &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the curve with the greater y-value.

::&lt;math&gt; \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} x \dot y \, dt  = - \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} y \dot x \, dt  =  {1 \over 2} \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} (x \dot y - y \dot x) \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
(see [[Green's theorem]]) or the ''z''-component of

*[[Prism (geometry)|prism]]: 2B + Ph, where ''B'' is the area of a base, ''P'' is the perimeter of a base, and ''h'' is the height of the prism.
*[[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]: &lt;math&gt;B + \frac{PL}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''B'' is the area of the base, ''P'' is the perimeter of the base, and ''L'' is the length of the slant.
*[[rectangular prism]]: &lt;math&gt;2 (\ell w + \ell  h + w h)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length, ''w'' is the width, and ''h'' is the height.

==Optimization==
Given a wire contour, the surface of least area spanning (&quot;filling&quot;) it is a [[minimal surface]].  Familiar examples include [[soap bubble]]s.

The question of the [[filling area conjecture|filling area]] of the [[Riemannian circle]] remains open.

{{Unit of length|m=149597870700}}
An '''astronomical unit''' (abbreviated as '''AU''', '''au''', '''a.u.''', or '''ua''') is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] equal to {{nowrap|{{convert|149597870700|m|mi|adj=off|sigfig=11}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=IAU WG on NSFA Current Best Estimates|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/CBE.html|accessdate = 25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately the mean [[Earth]]–[[Sun]] distance.

The symbol '''ua''' is recommended by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]],&lt;ref name=SIbrochure&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[international standard]] [[ISO 80000]], while '''au''' is recommended by the [[International Astronomical Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The IAU Style Manual (1989): The Preparation of Astronomical Papers and Reports|url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is more common in [[Anglosphere]] countries. In general, the [[International System of Units]] only uses capital letters for the symbols of units which are named after individual scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Ambler Thompson and Barry N. Taylor, (2008), [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)''], (Special publication 811), Gaithersburg, MD: [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], section 6.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; while '''au''' or '''a.u.''' can also mean [[atomic unit]] or even [[arbitrary unit]]. However, the use of '''AU''' to refer to the astronomical unit is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'', the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astronomical constant]] whose value is one astronomical unit is referred to as '''unit distance''' and is given the symbol ''A''.

==Definition==
{{See also|Earth's orbit}}
The AU was originally defined as the length of the [[semi-major axis]] of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun. In 1976 the International Astronomical Union revised the definition of the AU for greater precision, defining it as that length for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{nowrap|0.017 202 098 95}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU76&quot;&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trümper&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title= Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.

&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is approximately equal to the distance from the earth to the sun.

==Modern determinations==
Precise measurements of the relative positions of the [[Solar System#Inner planets|inner planets]] can be made by [[radar]] and by [[telemetry]] from [[space probe]]s. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [[photons]] to be reflected from an object. These measured positions are then compared with those calculated by the laws of [[celestial mechanics]]: an assembly of calculated positions is often referred to as an [[ephemeris]], in which distances are commonly calculated in astronomical units. One of several ephemeris computation services is provided by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Horizons&gt;

{{cite web |title=HORIZONS System |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons |work=Solar system dynamics |date=2005-01-04 |accessdate=2012-01-16 |publisher=NASA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The comparison of the ephemeris with the measured positions leads to a value for the [[speed of light]] in astronomical units, which is {{nowrap|173.144 632 6847(69)}}&amp;nbsp;AU/d ([[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf 2009 Selected Astronomical Constants]&quot; in {{citation|title=The Astronomical Almanac Online|url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed of light in meters per second ([http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?c ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]) is fixed in the [[International System of Units]], this measurement of the speed of light in AU/d (''c''&lt;sub&gt;AU&lt;/sub&gt;) also determines the value of the astronomical unit in meters (''A''):
:&lt;math&gt;A = 86\,400 \frac{c_{\rm 0}}{c_{\rm AU}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The best current (2009) estimate of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) for the value of the astronomical unit in meters is ''A''&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|149 597 870 700(3)}}&amp;nbsp;m, based on a comparison of [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] and [[Russian Academy of Sciences|IAA–RAS]] ephemerides.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva09&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1=Pitjeva|first1=E.

==Usage==
By definition, the astronomical unit is dependent on the [[heliocentric gravitational constant]], that is the product of the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the solar mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. Neither ''G'' nor ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured to high accuracy in SI units, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an ephemeris, which explains why ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on the surface of the Earth ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer in Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter in Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the &quot;planetary second&quot; (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between the Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{nowrap|0.983&amp;thinsp;289&amp;thinsp;8912}}&amp;nbsp;AU and {{nowrap|1.016&amp;thinsp;710&amp;thinsp;3335}}&amp;nbsp;AU) and, when the Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and the Earth is moving faster along its [[Earth's orbit|orbital path]]. As the meter is defined in terms of the second, and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial meter appears to change in length compared to the &quot;planetary meter&quot; on a periodic basis.

The meter is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that &quot;its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the meter is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit is incomplete, in particular because it does not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but has proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity has been proposed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Huang&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Huang, T.-Y.; Han, C.-H.; Yi, Z.-H.; Xu, B.-X.|year=1995|title=What is the astronomical unit of length?|bibcode=1995A&amp;A...298..629H|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics|Astron. Astrophys.]]|volume=298|pages=629–33|last2=Han|last3=Yi|last4=Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;vigorous debate&quot; is underway.&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The AU is too small for interstellar distances, where the [[parsec]] is commonly used. See the article [[cosmic distance ladder]]. The [[light year]] is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit.&lt;ref name=Dodd1&gt;

See, for example, the work cited above: {{cite book |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&amp;pg=PA82 |chapter=§6.2.8: Light year |isbn=0-521-76917-5}}

==History==
According to [[Archimedes]] in the ''[[Sand Reckoner | Sandreckoner]]'' (2.1), [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be 10,000 times the Earth's radius (the true value is about 23,000).&lt;ref name=Gomez&gt;Gomez, A. G. (2011) '' Aristarchos of Samos the Polymath'' [online], http://www.jscimath.org/uploads/J2011173AG.pdf''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''[[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has long been ascribed to Aristarchus, says that he calculated the distance to the sun to be between 18 and 20 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the Moon]], whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the [[Lunar phase|half moon]] and the Sun, which he estimated as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°). Depending on the distance Van Helden assumes Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and 1,520 Earth radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=5–9|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the sun to be &quot;σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας&quot; (literally &quot;of ''stadia'' [[myriad]]s 400 and 80000&quot;). This has been translated either as 4,080,000 ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]'' (1903 translation by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]]), or as 804,000,000 ''stadia'' (edition of [[Édouard des Places]], dated 1974-1991).

According to the conjectural reconstructions of [[Noel Swerdlow]] and [[G. J. Toomer]], this was derived from his assumption of a &quot;least perceptible&quot; solar parallax of 7 arc minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00329826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[China|Chinese]] mathematical treatise, the ''[[Zhou Bi Suan Jing|Zhoubi suanjing]]'' (ca. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places 1000 [[Li (length)|li]] apart and the assumption that the Earth is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G.

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the mean distance of the Sun as 1,210 times the [[Earth radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|title=The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses''|journal=Trans. Am. Phil. Soc.|volume=57|issue=4|year=1967|pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=15–27|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′, which was much too large. He then derived a maximum lunar distance of 64 1/6 Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.&lt;ref name=vh1619&gt;pp. 16–19, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 251, ''Ptolemy's Almagest'',
translated and annotated by G. J. Toomer, London: Duckworth, 1984, ISBN 0-7156-1588-2&lt;/ref&gt; He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of the Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from the Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be 1,210 Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.&lt;ref name=vh1619/&gt;

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [[al-Farghānī]] gave a mean solar distance of 1,170 Earth radii, while in his ''[[zij]]'', [[al-Battānī]] used a mean solar distance of 1,108 Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as [[al-Bīrūnī]], used similar values.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 29–33, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Europe, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] also used comparable figures (1,142 Earth radii and 1,150 Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 41–53, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]] was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' (1627). [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for the Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [[Godefroy Wendelin]] repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]].&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;

An extended historical discussion of this method is provided by {{cite web |title=Quest for the astronomical unit |author =Trudy E Bell |url=http://www.tbp.org/pages/publications/bent/features/su04bell.pdf |work=The Bent of Tau Beta Pi, Summer 2004, p. 20 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}

&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the [[parallax]] of Venus and from the relative distance of the Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [[Parallax#Solar_parallax|solar parallax]] ''α'' (which cannot be measured directly&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Weaver|first=Harold F.|title=The Solar Parallax|bibcode=1943ASPL....4..144W|year=1943|journal=Astron. Soc. Pacific Leaflets|volume=4|pages=144–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] had attempted to produce an estimate based on [[Transit of Venus, 1639|his observation of the 1639 transit]] (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 [[arcsecond]]s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] by
:&lt;math&gt;A = {\cot\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and the Earth: a solar parallax of 15&quot; is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of 13,750 Earth radii.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] believed the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [[Mars]], he estimated a value of about 24,000 Earth radii,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goldstein|first=S. J., Jr.|title=Christiaan Huygens' Measurement of the Distance to the Sun|bibcode=1985Obs...105...32G|journal=Observatory|year=1985|volume=105|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6&quot;. Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[[File:Venustransit 2004-06-08 07-44.jpg|thumb|right|Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so-called &quot;[[black drop effect]]&quot;) and the rarity of observations.]]
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9½&quot;, equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about 22,000 Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of the Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as 3,269 thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Another colleague, [[Ole Rømer]], discovered the finite [[speed of light]] in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or &quot;light time per unit distance&quot;, a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and published in his ''[[Optica Promata]]'' (1663). It was strongly advocated by [[Edmond Halley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halley|first=E.|authorlink=Edmond Halley|year=1716|title=A new Method of determining the Parallax of the Sun, or his Distance from the Earth|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London|volume=29|pages=454–64|url=http://www.dsellers.demon.co.uk/venus/ven_ch8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Despite the [[Seven Years' War]], dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pogge|first=Richard|title=How Far to the Sun?

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]], and [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of 8.794143″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance) this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometers. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;Conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales, Paris, 18–21 May 1896&lt;/ref&gt; which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;astronomical unit&quot; appears first to have been used in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near the Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hinks|first=Arthur R.|authorlink=Arthur Robert Hinks|title=Solar Parallax Papers No. 7: The General Solution from the Photographic Right Ascensions of Eros, at the Opposition of 1900|journal=Month. Not. R. Astron. Soc.|volume=69|issue=7|pages=544–67|year=1909|bibcode=1909MNRAS..69..544H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another international project to measure the parallax of 433 Eros was undertaken in 1930–1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Spencer Jones|first=H.|authorlink=Harold Spencer Jones|title=The Solar Parallax and the Mass of the Moon from Observations of Eros at the Opposition of 1931|journal=Mem. R. Astron. Soc.|volume=66|year=1941|pages=11–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mikhailov|first=A. A.|year=1964|title=The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax|bibcode=1964SvA.....7..737M|journal=Sov. Astron.|volume=7|issue=6|pages=737–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
[[Image:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|The astronomical distance unit [[parsec]] uses the AU as a baseline and an angle of one [[arcsecond]] for [[parallax]]. 1 AU and 1 pc not to scale. (See also [[stellar parallax]])]]
The unit distance ''A'' (the value of the astronomical unit in meters) can be expressed in terms of other [[astronomical constant]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;A^3 = \frac{D^2}{G M_\odot k^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[solar mass]], ''k'' is the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] and ''D'' is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Noedlinger, Peter D.|arxiv=0801.3807|title=Solar Mass Loss, the Astronomical Unit, and the Scale of the Solar System|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|Celest. Mech. Dynam. Astron.]]|bibcode = 2008arXiv0801.3807N|volume=0801|year=2008|pages=3807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13286-astronomical-unit-may-need-to-be-redefined.html?feedId=online-news_rss20|title=AU may need to be redefined|newspaper=New Scientist|date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been calls to redefine the astronomical unit in terms of a fixed number of meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Capitaine|first1=N|last2=Guinot|first2=B|eprint=0812.2970|title=The astronomical units|year=2008|version=v1|class=astro-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[speed of light]] has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant ''k'' is fixed in the [[astronomical system of units]], measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product ''GM''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [[secular variation|secular increase]] in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +15±4&amp;nbsp;meters per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Krasinsky, G. A.; Brumberg, V. A.|title=Secular increase of astronomical unit from analysis of the major planet motions, and its interpretation|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g5051650115444k9/|journal=Celest. Mech. Dynam.

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial. 
Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides (.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Fienga, A.et al.|title=The INPOP10a planetary ephemeris and its applications in fundamental physics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5456227385812m7/?MUD=MP|journal=Celest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acoustic theory''' is the field relating to mathematical description of [[sound]] [[waves]]. It is derived from [[fluid dynamics]]. See [[acoustics]] for the [[engineering]] approach.

The propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of motion (conservation of [[momentum]]) and an equation of continuity (conservation of [[mass]]).  With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     \rho_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla p &amp; = 0  \qquad \text{(Momentum balance)} \\
     \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa~\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} &amp; = 0  \qquad \text{(Mass balance)}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic pressure and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic fluid velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the static mass density of the medium and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bulk modulus]] of the medium.  The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium (&lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;) as
: &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \rho_0 c_0^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[acoustic wave equation]] is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as &lt;ref&gt;Douglas D. Reynolds. (1981). ''Engineering Principles in Acoustics'', Allyn and Bacon Inc., Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial^2 \mathbf{v}}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2\mathbf{v} = 0
   \qquad \text{or} \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 p = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The acoustic wave equation (and the mass and momentum balance equations) are often expressed in terms of a [[scalar potential]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \nabla\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  In that case the acoustic wave equation is written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 \varphi = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the momentum balance and mass balance are expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   p + \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \rho + \cfrac{\rho_0}{c_0^2}~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation of the governing equations==
The derivations of the above equations for waves in an acoustic medium are given below.

===Conservation of momentum===
The equations for the [[Derivation_of_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#General_form_of_the_Navier.E2.80.93Stokes_equations|conservation of linear momentum]] for a fluid medium are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\boldsymbol{s} + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the body force per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the deviatoric stress.  If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the  Cauchy stress, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   p := -\tfrac{1}{3}~\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) ~;~~
   \boldsymbol{s} := \boldsymbol{\sigma} + p~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the rank-2 identity tensor.

We make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium.  These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.

====Assumption 1: Newtonian fluid====
In acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]].  For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the velocity by
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s} = \mu~\left[\nabla\mathbf{v} + (\nabla\mathbf{v})^T\right] +
       \lambda~(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the shear [[viscosity]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bulk viscosity]].

Therefore, the divergence of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{s} \equiv \cfrac{\partial s_{ij}}{\partial x_i} &amp; = 
     \mu \left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+\cfrac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\right] + \lambda~\left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_k}{\partial x_k}\right)\right]\delta_{ij} \\
    &amp; = \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_j}{\partial x_i\partial x_i} + \lambda~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_k}{\partial x_k\partial x_j} \\
    &amp; = (\mu + \lambda)~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_j}{\partial x_i^2} \\
    &amp; \equiv (\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) + \mu~\nabla^2\mathbf{v} ~.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the identity &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\mathbf{v} = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) - \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{s} = (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) -
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v}~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) -
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v} + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 2: Irrotational flow====
For most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the [[vorticity]] is zero.  In that case
:&lt;math&gt;
   \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the momentum equation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 3: No body forces====
Another frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible.  The momentum equation then further simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v})
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 4: No viscous forces====
Additionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 5: Small disturbances====
An important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small.  This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation.  Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field (&lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt;) that varies in space and time.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~
   \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v} = \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{v}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the momentum equation can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right] \left[\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t}  + \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right] \cdot \nabla \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right]\right] = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} &amp; +
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{v}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right] \\
   &amp; = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right]
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 6: Homogeneous medium====
Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables
&lt;math&gt;\langle p \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \rho \rangle&lt;/math&gt; have zero gradients, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\langle p \rangle =  0 ~;~~ \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The momentum equation then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} +
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{v}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]
   = -\nabla\tilde{p}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 7: Medium at rest====
At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest which implies that the mean velocity is zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the balance of momentum reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
    \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\tilde{p}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Dropping the tildes and using &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 := \langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation
:&lt;math&gt;
    \rho_0~\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla p = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation of mass===
The equation for the [[Derivation_of_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Conservation_of_mass|conservation of mass]] in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of the fluid and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid velocity.

The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.

====Assumption 1: Small disturbances====
From the assumption of small disturbances we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~
   \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v} = \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{v}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the mass balance equation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right] +
   \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right]= 0
  &lt;/math&gt;
If we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations, the mass balance equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
    \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \nabla\langle\rho\rangle\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}}= 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 2: Homogeneous medium====
Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the mass balance equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
    \nabla\tilde{\rho}\cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle
    = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 3: Medium at rest====
At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the mass balance equation can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 4: Ideal gas, adiabatic, reversible====
In order to close the system of equations we need an [[equation of state]] for the pressure.  To do that we assume that the medium is an [[ideal gas]] and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an [[adiabatic]] and [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] manner.  The equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~;~~ \gamma := \cfrac{c_p}{c_v} ~;~~ c^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure, &lt;math&gt;c_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the wave speed.  The value of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is 1.4 if the acoustic medium is air.

For small disturbances
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} \approx \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}}  ~;~~
   \cfrac{p}{\rho} \approx \cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~;~~
   c^2 \approx c_0^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~\langle p\rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]] in the medium.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}} = \gamma~\cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle}
     = c_0^2 \qquad \implies \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} = c_0^2 \cfrac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The balance of mass can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;
Dropping the tildes and defining &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 :=  \langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \rho_0~c_0^2~\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v} = 0 ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Governing equations in cylindrical coordinates==
If we use a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta,z)&lt;/math&gt; with [[basis vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_\theta, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the [[divergence]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \nabla p &amp; = \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z \\
     \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[velocity]] has been expressed as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v_r~\mathbf{e}_r+v_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta+v_z~\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;.

The equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] may then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho_0~\left[\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_r+\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_\theta+\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_z\right] +
\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components, these three equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] in [[cylindrical coordinates]] are
:&lt;math&gt;
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}  = 0 ~;~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial t} + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}  = 0 ~;~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}  = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

The equation for the [[conservation of mass]] can similarly be written in [[cylindrical coordinates]] as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa\left[\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}\right] = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Time harmonic acoustic equations in cylindrical coordinates===
The acoustic equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] and the [[conservation of mass]] are often expressed in time [[harmonic]] form (at fixed [[frequency]]).  In that case, the pressures and the velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{p}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{\mathbf{v}}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~ i := \sqrt{-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency.  Substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in [[cylindrical coordinates]] gives us the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of momentum]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial r} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_r ~;~~
   \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial \theta} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_\theta ~;~~
    \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial z} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of mass]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{i\omega \hat{p}}{\kappa} = \cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_\theta}{\partial \theta} + \hat{v}_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_z}{\partial z} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Special case: No z-dependence====
In the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z-coordinate we can eliminate &lt;math&gt;v_r, v_\theta&lt;/math&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} +
     \frac{1}{r^2}~\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial\theta^2} + \frac{\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~p = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that the solution of this equation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    p(r,\theta) = R(r)~Q(\theta)
 &lt;/math&gt;
we can write the partial differential equation as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{r^2}{R}~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + \cfrac{r}{R}~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa} = -\cfrac{1}{Q}~\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side is not a function of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; while the right hand side is not a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   r^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~R = \alpha^2~R ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.  Using the substitution
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tilde{r} \leftarrow \left(\omega\sqrt{\cfrac{\rho_0}{\kappa}}\right) r = k~r
 &lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tilde{r}^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{d\tilde{r}^2} + \tilde{r}~\cfrac{dR}{d\tilde{r}} + (\tilde{r}^2-\alpha^2)~R = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q
 &lt;/math&gt;
The equation on the left is the [[Bessel equation]] which has the general solution
:&lt;math&gt;
   R(r) =  A_\alpha~J_\alpha(k~r) + B_\alpha~J_{-\alpha}(k~r)
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the cylindrical [[Bessel function]] of the first kind and &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha, B_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are undetermined constants.  The equation on the right has the general solution
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q(\theta) = C_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + D_\alpha~e^{-i\alpha\theta}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_\alpha,D_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are undetermined constants.  Then the solution of the acoustic wave equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r,\theta) = \left[A_\alpha~J_\alpha(k~r) + B_\alpha~J_{-\alpha}(k~r)\right]\left(C_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + D_\alpha~e^{-i\alpha\theta}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
Boundary conditions are needed at this stage to determine &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the other undetermined constants.

The '''Advanced Encryption Standard''' ('''AES''') is a specification for the [[encryption]] of electronic data established by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in 2002. Originally called '''Rijndael''', the [[cipher]] was developed by two [[Belgium|Belgian]] cryptographers, [[Joan Daemen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]], who submitted to the AES selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. Selects a New Encryption Technique |author=John Schwartz |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 3, 2000 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/03/business/technology-us-selects-a-new-encryption-technique.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AES has been adopted by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] and is now used worldwide. It supersedes the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IKZ/is_3_107?pnum=2&amp;opg=90984479 |title=NIST reports measurable success of Advanced Encryption Standard | work=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | first=Harold B. | last=Westlund | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm described by AES is a [[symmetric-key algorithm]], meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.

In the [[United States]], AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001. This announcement followed a five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]] for more details). It became effective as a federal government standard on May 26, 2002 after approval by the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. AES is included in the ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard. AES is available in many different encryption packages, and is the first publicly accessible and open [[cipher]] approved by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) for [[Classified information|top secret]] information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard#Security|Security of AES]], below).

The name ''Rijndael'' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrɛindaːl}}) is a play on the names of the two inventors. Strictly speaking, the AES standard is a variant of Rijndael where the block size is restricted to 128 bits.

== Description of the cipher ==
AES is based on a design principle known as a [[substitution-permutation network]], and is fast in both software and hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf |title=The Twofish Team’s Final Comments on AES Selection |author=Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, Niels Ferguson, Tadayoshi Kohno, Mike Stay |date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a [[Feistel network]]. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed  [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s, and a [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification ''per se'' is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.

AES operates on a 4×4 [[column-major order]] matrix of bytes, termed the ''state'', although some versions of Rijndael have a larger block size and have additional columns in the state. Most AES calculations are done in a special [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].

The key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the plaintext, into the final output, called the ciphertext. The number of cycles of repetition are as follows:

* 10 cycles of repetition for 128 bit keys.
* 12 cycles of repetition for 192 bit keys.
* 14 cycles of repetition for 256 bit keys.

Each round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

=== High-level description of the algorithm ===

# KeyExpansion—round keys are derived from the cipher key using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]
# Initial Round
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;—each byte of the state is combined with the round key using bitwise xor
# Rounds
## &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;—a non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].
## &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;—a transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
## &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt;—a mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;
# Final Round (no &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt;)
## &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;
## &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;

=== The &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-SubBytes.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, ''S''; ''b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S(a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;)''.]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte in the ''state'' matrix is replaced with a &lt;tt&gt;SubByte&lt;/tt&gt; using an 8-bit [[substitution box]], the [[Rijndael S-box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[multiplicative inverse]] over '''[[Finite field|GF]]'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;''), known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), and also any opposite fixed points.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-ShiftRows.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs for each row.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [[Offset (computer science)|offset]]. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively. For blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits, the shifting pattern is the same. Row n is shifted left circular by n-1 bytes. In this way, each column of the output state of the &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. (Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets). For a 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively—this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-MixColumns.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial ''c(x)''.]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [[linear transformation]]. The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher.

During this operation, each column is multiplied by the known matrix that for the 128 bit key is

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The multiplication operation is defined as: multiplication by 1 means no change, multiplication by 2 means shifting to the left, and multiplication by 3 means shifting to the left and then performing [[xor]] with the initial unshifted value. After shifting, a conditional [[xor]] with 0x1B should be performed if the shifted value is larger than 0xFF.

In more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over '''GF'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'') and is then multiplied modulo x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+1 with a fixed polynomial c(x) = 0x03 · x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x + 0x02. The coefficients are displayed in their [[hexadecimal]] equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from '''GF'''(2)[x]. The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step can also be viewed as a multiplication by a particular [[MDS matrix]] in a [[finite field]]. This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael mix columns]].

=== The &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-AddRoundKey.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation (⊕).]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[Exclusive or|XOR]].

=== Optimization of the cipher ===
On systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; steps with the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables, and utilizes a total of four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of memory — one kilobyte for each table. A round then be done with 16 table lookups and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/UVX5NQGNN55VK199.pdf &quot;Efficient software implementation of AES on 32-bit platforms&quot;.] Lecture Notes in Computer Science: 2523. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

If the resulting four kilobyte table size is too large for a given target platform, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit (i.e. 1 kilobyte) table by the use of circular rotates.

Using a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; steps into a single round operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
Until May 2009, the only successful published attacks against the full AES were [[side-channel attack]]s on some specific implementations. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data. In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES could be used to protect [[classified information]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/aes/CNSS15FS.pdf |title=National Policy on the Use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National Security Systems and National Security Information |author=Lynn Hathaway |date=June 2003  |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

AES has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. By 2006, the best known attacks were on 7 rounds for 128-bit keys, 8 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 9 rounds for 256-bit keys.&lt;ref name=improved&gt;[[John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)|John Kelsey]], [[Stefan Lucks]], [[Bruce Schneier]], [[Mike Stay]], [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]], and [[Doug Whiting]], ''Improved Cryptanalysis of Rijndael'', [[Fast Software Encryption]], 2000 pp213–230 [http://www.schneier.com/paper-rijndael.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Known attacks ===
For cryptographers, a [[cryptanalysis|cryptographic]] &quot;break&quot; is anything faster than a [[Brute-force attack|brute force]]—performing one trial decryption for each key (see [[Cryptanalysis#Computational_resources_required|Cryptanalysis]]). This includes results that are infeasible with current technology. The largest successful publicly known [[brute force attack]] against any block-cipher encryption was against a 64-bit [[RC5]] key by [[distributed.net]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=ZD20060430&gt;{{cite web

AES has a fairly simple algebraic description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sean/ |title=Sean Murphy |publisher=University of London |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a theoretical attack, termed the &quot;[[XSL attack]]&quot;, was announced by [[Nicolas Courtois]] and [[Josef Pieprzyk]], purporting to show a weakness in the AES algorithm due to its simple description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0209.html | title = AES News, Crypto-Gram Newsletter, September 15, 2002 | author = Bruce Schneier | accessdate = 2007-07-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070707105715/http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0209.html| archivedate= 7 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, other papers have shown that the attack as originally presented is unworkable; see [[XSL_attack#Application_to_block_ciphers|XSL attack on block ciphers]].

During the AES process, developers of competing algorithms wrote of Rijndael, &quot;...we are concerned about [its] use...in security-critical applications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rijndael-algebraic&quot;&gt;

This new attack, by Alex Biryukov, Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, Dmitry Khovratovich, and [[Adi Shamir]], is against AES-256 that uses only two related keys and 2&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; time to recover the complete 256-bit key of a 9-round version, or 2&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; time for a 10-round version with a stronger type of related subkey attack, or 2&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; time for an 11-round version. 256-bit AES uses 14 rounds, so these attacks aren't effective against full AES.

In November 2009, the first [[known-key distinguishing attack]] against a reduced 8-round version of AES-128 was released as a preprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web

This known-key distinguishing attack is an improvement of the rebound or the start-from-the-middle attacks for AES-like permutations, which view two consecutive rounds of permutation as the application of a so-called Super-Sbox. It works on the 8-round version of AES-128, with a time complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;, and a memory complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.

In July 2010 Vincent Rijmen published an ironic paper on &quot;chosen-key-relations-in-the-middle&quot; attacks on AES-128.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/337.pdf |title=Practical-Titled Attack on AES-128 Using Chosen-Text Relations |author=Vincent Rijmen |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[key-recovery attack]]s on full AES were due to Andrey Bogdanov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Christian Rechberger, and were published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cryptanalysis/aesbc.pdf |title=Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES |author=Andrey Bogdanov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Christian Rechberger |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack is based on bicliques and is faster than brute force by a factor of about four. It requires 2&lt;sup&gt;126.1&lt;/sup&gt; operations to recover an AES-128 key. For AES-192 and AES-256, 2&lt;sup&gt;189.7&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;254.4&lt;/sup&gt; operations are needed, respectively.

=== Side-channel attacks ===&lt;!-- possibly out of date? --&gt;
[[Side-channel attacks]] do not attack the underlying cipher{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and so have nothing to do with its security as described here, but attack implementations of the cipher on systems which inadvertently leak data. There are several such known attacks on certain implementations of AES.

In April 2005, [[Daniel J. Bernstein|D.J. Bernstein]] announced a cache-timing attack that he used to break a custom server that used [[OpenSSL]]'s AES encryption.&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein_timing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#cachetiming |title=Index of formal scientific papers |publisher=Cr.yp.to |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/05/aes_timing_atta_1.html | title = AES Timing Attack | author = Bruce Schneier | accessdate = 2007-03-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070212015727/http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/05/aes_timing_atta_1.html| archivedate= 12 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible (the server reports back the number of machine cycles taken by the encryption operation); however, as Bernstein pointed out, &quot;reducing the precision of the server’s timestamps, or eliminating them from the server’s responses, does not stop the attack: the client simply uses round-trip timings based on its local clock, and compensates for the increased noise by averaging over a larger number of samples.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein_timing&quot; /&gt;

In October 2005, Dag Arne Osvik, [[Adi Shamir]] and Eran Tromer presented a paper demonstrating several cache-timing attacks against AES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache.pdf |title=Cache Attacks and Countermeasures: the Case of AES |format=PDF |date=2005-11-20 |author=Dag Arne Osvik1|coauthors =Adi Shamir2 and Eran Tromer2 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One attack was able to obtain an entire AES key after only 800 operations triggering encryptions, in a total of 65 milliseconds. This attack requires the attacker to be able to run programs on the same system or platform that is performing AES.

In December 2009 an attack on some hardware implementations was published that used [[differential fault analysis]] and allows recovery of a key with a complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/581.pdf |title=A Diagonal Fault Attack on the Advanced Encryption Standard |author=Dhiman Saha, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Dipanwita RoyChowdhury |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091222070135/http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/581.pdf| archivedate= 22 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Endre Bangerter, David Gullasch and Stephan Krenn published a paper which described a practical approach to a &quot;near real time&quot; recovery of secret keys from AES-128 without the need for either cipher text or plaintext. The approach also works on AES-128 implementations that use compression tables, such as OpenSSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/594.pdf |title=Cache Games – Bringing Access-Based Cache Attacks on AES to Practice |author=Endre Bangerter, David Gullasch and Stephan Krenn |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like some earlier attacks this one requires the ability to run unprivileged code on the system performing the AES encryption, which may be achieved by malware infection far more easily than commandeering the root account.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1937902&lt;/ref&gt;

== NIST/CSEC validation ==
The [[CMVP|Cryptographic Module Validation Program]] (CMVP) is operated jointly by the United States Government's [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) Computer Security Division and the [[Communications Security Establishment]] (CSE) of the Government of Canada. The use of cryptographic modules validated to NIST FIPS 140-2 is required by the United States Government for encryption of all data that has a classification of Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) or above. From NSTISSP #11, National Policy Governing the Acquisition of Information Assurance: “Encryption products for protecting classified information will be certified by NSA, and encryption products intended for protecting sensitive information will be certified in accordance with NIST FIPS 140-2.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissp_11_fs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Canada also recommends the use of [[FIPS 140]] validated cryptographic modules in unclassified applications of its departments.

Although NIST publication 197 (&quot;FIPS 197&quot;) is the unique document that covers the AES algorithm, vendors typically approach the CMVP under FIPS 140 and ask to have several algorithms (such as [[Triple DES|Triple&amp;nbsp;DES]] or [[SHA1]]) validated at the same time. Therefore, it is rare to find cryptographic modules that are uniquely FIPS 197 validated and NIST itself does not generally take the time to list FIPS 197 validated modules separately on its public web site. Instead, FIPS 197 validation is typically just listed as an &quot;FIPS approved: AES&quot; notation (with a specific FIPS 197 certificate number) in the current list of FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules.

The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)&lt;ref&gt;http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; allows for independent validation of the correct implementation of the AES algorithm at a reasonable cost{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Successful validation results in being listed on the NIST validations page. This testing is a pre-requisite for the FIPS 140-2 module validation described below. However, successful CAVP validation in no way implies that the cryptographic module implementing the algorithm is secure. Lacking FIPS 140-2 validation or specific approval by the NSA, a cryptographic module is not deemed secure by the US Government and cannot be used to protect government data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissp_11_fs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FIPS 140-2 validation is challenging to achieve both technically and fiscally.&lt;ref name=&quot;openssl&quot;&gt;[http://openssl.org/docs/fips/fipsnotes.html OpenSSL's Notes about FIPS certification]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a standardized battery of tests as well as an element of source code review that must be passed over a period of a few weeks. The cost to perform these tests through an approved laboratory can be significant (e.g., well over $30,000 US)&lt;ref name=&quot;openssl&quot; /&gt; and does not include the time it takes to write, test, document and prepare a module for validation. After validation, modules must be re-submitted and re-evaluated if they are changed in any way. This can vary from simple paperwork updates if the security functionality did not change to a more substantial set of re-testing if the security functionality was impacted by the change.

== Test vectors ==
Test vectors are a set of known ciphers for a given input and key.  [[NIST]] distributes the reference of AES test vectors as [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip AES Known Answer Test (KAT) Vectors (in ZIP format)].

== Performance ==
High speed and low RAM requirements were criteria of the AES selection process. Thus AES performs well on a wide variety of hardware, from 8-bit [[smart card]]s to high-performance computers.

On a [[Pentium Pro]], AES encryption requires 18 clock cycles / byte,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a throughput of about 11 MiB/s for a 200&amp;nbsp;MHz processor. On a [[Pentium M]] 1.7&amp;nbsp;GHz throughput is about 60 MiB/s.

On Intel i5/i7 CPUs supporting [[AES instruction set|AES-NI instruction set]] extensions throughput is about 400MiB/s per thread.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{See also|Generic property}}
In [[mathematics]], the phrase '''&quot;almost all&quot;''' has a number of specialised uses.

&quot;Almost all&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;all but [except] [[finite set|finite]]ly many&quot; (formally, a [[cofinite]] set) or &quot;all but a [[countable set]]&quot; (formally, a [[cocountable]] set); see [[almost]].

A simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd. (Two is a prime number.)

When speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes it means &quot;all reals but a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero&quot; (formally, [[almost everywhere]]). In this sense almost all reals are not a member of the [[Cantor set]] even though the Cantor set is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].

In [[number theory]], if ''P''(''n'') is a property of positive [[integer]]s, and if ''p''(''N'') denotes the number of [[positive integers]] ''n'' less than ''N'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds, and if 

:''p''(''N'')/''N'' → 1 as ''N'' → ∞

(see [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]), then we say that &quot;''P''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''&quot; (formally, [[asymptotically almost surely]]) and write
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall^\infty n) P(n).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to ''N'' is asymptotically equal to ''N''/ln ''N''. Therefore the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''N'', which tends to 0. Thus, ''almost all'' positive integers are [[composite number|composite]] (not prime), however there are still an infinite number of primes.

Occasionally, &quot;almost all&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;[[almost everywhere]]&quot; in [[measure theory]], or in the closely related sense of &quot;[[almost surely]]&quot; in [[probability theory]].

[[Image:Particles and antiparticles.svg|thumb|alt=Diagram illustrating the particles and antiparticles of electron, neutron and proton, as well as their &quot;size&quot; (not to scale). It is easier to identify them by looking at the total mass of both the antiparticle and particle. On the left, from top to bottom, is shown an electron (small red dot), a proton (big blue dot), and a neutron (big dot, black in the middle, gradually fading to white near the edges). On the right, from top to bottom, are show the antielectron (small blue dot), antiproton (big red dot) and antineutron (big dot, white in the middle, fading to black near the edges).|Illustration of electric charge as well as general size of [[particle]]s (left) and antiparticles (right). From top to bottom; [[electron]]/[[positron]], [[proton]]/[[antiproton]], [[neutron]]/[[antineutron]].]]

Corresponding to most kinds of [[particle physics|particles]], there is an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] and opposite [[electric charge]]. For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the positively charged antielectron, or [[positron]], which is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]].

The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an [[antiproton]] and a positron can form an [[antihydrogen]] [[atom]], which has almost exactly the same properties as a [[hydrogen]] atom. This leads to the question of why the [[baryogenesis|formation of matter after the Big Bang]] resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and [[antimatter]]. The discovery of [[CP violation]] helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.

Particle-antiparticle pairs can [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other, producing [[photon]]s; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of [[gamma rays]], a process exploited in [[positron emission tomography]].

Antiparticles are produced naturally in [[beta decay]], and in the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s in the Earth's atmosphere. Because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge (as in beta decay) or creating a particle of the opposite charge. The latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously, as in [[particle accelerator]]s. This is the inverse of the particle-antiparticle annihilation process.

Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of [[quarks]], the [[antineutron]] from [[Quark#Antiquarks|antiquarks]], and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as [[photon]]s, the hypothetical [[graviton]]s, and some [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]s.

== History ==
=== Experiment ===

In 1932, soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D. Anderson]] found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a [[cloud chamber]]&amp;mdash; a [[particle detector]] in which moving [[electron]]s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a [[magnetic field]]. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.  Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.

The [[antiproton]] and [[antineutron]] were found by [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]] in 1955 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of [[antimatter]] have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/11/101118-antimatter-trapped-engines-bombs-nature-science-cern/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hole theory ===
{{quote box|quote=... the development of [[quantum field theory]] made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary, even though it lingers on in many textbooks.|source=[[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|title=The quantum theory of fields, Volume 1 : Foundations|isbn=0-521-55001-7|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=300px}}
Solutions of the [[Dirac equation]] contained negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a &quot;sea&quot; of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this [[Dirac sea]] to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a ''[[electron hole|hole]]'' in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These he interpreted as &quot;negative-energy electrons&quot; and attempted to identify them with [[proton]]s in his 1930 paper ''A Theory of Electrons and Protons''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul
 |year=1930
 |title=A Theory of Electrons and Protons
 |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]
 |volume=126 |issue= |pages=360–365
 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1930.0013
|bibcode = 1930RSPSA.126..360D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these &quot;negative-energy electrons&quot; turned out to be [[positron]]s, and not [[proton]]s.

Dirac was aware of the problem that his picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until [[Hermann Weyl]] proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Proton+}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}, where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Igor Tamm]] proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

However, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains. Also, as we now know, [[bosons]] also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only [[fermions]] do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in [[quantum field theory]], which solves both these problems.

== Particle-antiparticle annihilation ==
{{main|Annihilation}}
[[Image:kkbar had.svg|frame|alt=Feynman diagram of a kaon oscillation. A straight red line suddenly turns purple, showing a kaon changing changing into an antikaon. A medallion is show zooming in on the region where the line changes color. The medallion shows that the line is not straight, but rather that at the place the kaon changes into an antikaon, the red line breaks into two curved lines, corresponding the production of virtual pions, which rejoin into the violet line, corresponding to the annihilation of the virtual pions. |An example of a virtual [[pion]] pair that influences the propagation of a [[kaon]], causing a neutral kaon to ''mix'' with the antikaon. This is an example of [[renormalization]] in [[quantum field theory]]&amp;mdash; the field theory being necessary because the number of particles changes from one to two and back again.]]

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→ &amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}} (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) are an example. The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair, {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}, cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the [[translational invariance]] is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse reaction (in free space, without an atomic nucleus) is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may ''fluctuate'' into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the [[vacuum state]] and [[renormalization]] of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of [[mass renormalization]].

[[Quantum state]]s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] ('''C'''), [[P-symmetry|parity]] ('''P'''), and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] ('''T''') operators. If &lt;math&gt;|p,\sigma ,n \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the quantum state of a particle ('''n''') with momentum '''p''', spin '''J''' whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has
::&lt;math&gt;CPT \ |p,\sigma,n \rangle\ =\ (-1)^{J-\sigma}\ |p,-\sigma,n^c \rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;''' denotes the charge conjugate state, ''i.e.'', the antiparticle. This behaviour under '''CPT''' is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]]. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If '''T''' is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then
::&lt;math&gt;T\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,-\sigma,n\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;CP\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have
*the same mass '''m'''
*the same spin state '''J'''
*opposite [[electric charge]]s '''q''' and '''-q'''.

== Quantum field theory ==

''This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].''

One may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

::&lt;math&gt;\psi (x)=\sum_{k}u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where we use the symbol ''k'' to denote the quantum numbers ''p'' and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, ''E(k)'', and ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k} E(k) a^\dagger_k a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of ''H'' need not be positive. This is because ''E(k)'' can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

::&lt;math&gt;b_{k\prime} = a^\dagger_k\ \mathrm{and}\ b^\dagger_{k\prime}=a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' has the same ''p'', and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

::&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\sum_{k_+} u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t}+\sum_{k_-} u_k (x)b^\dagger _k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k_+} E_k a^\dagger _k a_k + \sum_{k_-} |E(k)|b^\dagger_k b_k + E_0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;a_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, '''H''' is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].

This approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.

=== Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation ===&lt;!--&quot;Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation&quot; and &quot;Stückelberg–Feynman interpretation&quot; redirect here--&gt;

By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass '''m''' and spin '''J''' but opposite charges '''q'''. This allowed him to rewrite [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] precisely in the form of diagrams. [[Richard Feynman]] later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called [[Feynman diagram]]s. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.

Since this picture was first developed by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], and acquired its modern form in Feynman's work, it is called the ''Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation'' of antiparticles to honor both scientists.

In [[mathematics]], the '''associative property''' is a property of some [[binary operation]]s. In [[propositional logic]], '''associativity''' is a [[validity|valid]] [[rule of replacement]] for [[well-formed formula|expressions]] in [[Formal proof|logical proofs]]. 

Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[operand]]s is not changed. That is, rearranging the [[Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29|parentheses]] in such an expression will not change its value. Consider, for instance, the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=5+(2+1)=8 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;5\times(5\times3)=(5\times5)\times3=75 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the first equation.  Even though the parentheses were rearranged (the left side requires adding 5 and 2 first, then adding 1 to the result, whereas the right side requires adding 2 and 1 first, then 5), the value of the expression was not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition on any [[real number]]s, we say that &quot;addition of real numbers is an associative operation.&quot;

Associativity is not to be confused with [[commutativity]]. Commutativity justifies changing the order or sequence of the operands within an expression while associativity does not. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=5+(2+1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of associativity because the parentheses were changed (and consequently the order of operations during evaluation) while the operands 5, 2, and 1 appeared in exactly the same order from left to right in the expression. In contrast,

:&lt;math&gt;(5+2)+1=(2+5)+1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of commutativity, not associativity, because the operand sequence changed when the 2 and 5 switched places.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[semigroup (mathematics)|semigroups]] and [[category (mathematics)|categories]]) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.

However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; one common example would be the [[vector cross product]].

== Definition ==
Formally, a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called '''associative''' if it satisfies the '''associative law''':

: &lt;math&gt;(x * y) * z=x * (y * z)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
: ''Using * to denote a [[binary operation]] performed on a set''

: &lt;math&gt;(xy)z=x(yz) = xyz \qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
:''An example of multiplicative associativity

The evaluation order does not affect the value of such expressions, and it can be shown that the same holds for expressions containing ''any'' number of &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durbin|first=John R.|title=Modern Algebra : an Introduction|year=1992|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-51001-7|pages=78|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000258.html|edition=3rd ed.|quote=If &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \,\, (n \ge 2)&lt;/math&gt; are elements of a set with an associative operation, then the product &lt;math&gt;a_1 a_2 \dots a_n&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous; this is, the same element will be obtained regardless of how parentheses are inserted in the product}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when &lt;math&gt;*\!\!\!&lt;/math&gt; is associative, the evaluation order can be left unspecified without causing ambiguity, by omitting the parentheses and writing simply:

:&lt;math&gt;xyz,&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is important to remember that changing the order of operations does not involve or permit moving the operands around within the expression; the sequence of operands is always unchanged.

The associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus : &lt;math&gt; f(f(x,y),z) = f(x,f(y,z))&lt;/math&gt;.

Associativity can be generalized to [[arity|n-ary operations]]. Ternary associativity is (abc)de = a(bcd)e = ab(cde), i.e. the string abcde with any three adjacent elements bracketed. N-ary associativity is a string of length n+(n-1) with any n adjacent elements bracketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Dudek |first=W.A. |title=On some old problems in n-ary groups |url=http://www.quasigroups.eu/contents/contents8.php?m=trzeci |journal=Quasigroups and Related Systems |year=2001 |volume=8 |pages= 15–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

Some examples of associative operations include the following.

* The [[string concatenation|concatenation]] of the three strings &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; can be computed by concatenating the first two strings (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello &quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and appending the third string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), or by joining the second and third string (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot; world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and concatenating the first string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) with the result. The two methods produce the same result; string concatenation is associative (but not commutative). 

* In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\quad
\\
(x\,y)z=x(y\,z)=x\,y\,z\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}.
&lt;/math&gt;
:Because of associativity, the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity.

* Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s is associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.

* The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
\operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\ \quad
\\
\operatorname{lcm}(\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}.
&lt;/math&gt;
* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]:
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
(A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C)=A\cap B\cap C\quad
\\
(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)=A\cup B\cup C\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.
&lt;/math&gt;

* If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[functional composition]] on ''S'' is associative:

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h\qquad\mbox{for all }f,g,h\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

* Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h&lt;/math&gt;

: as before. In short, composition of maps is always associative.

* Consider a set with three elements, A, B, and C. The following operation:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! × !! A !! B !! C
|-
! A
| A || A || A
|-
! B
| A || B || C
|-
! C
| A || A || A
|-
|}

is associative. Thus, for example, A(BC)=(AB)C. This mapping is not commutative.

* Because [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] represent [[Linear map|linear transformation]] functions, with [[matrix multiplication]] representing functional composition, one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative.

== Propositional logic ==
{{Transformation rules}}

=== Rule of replacement ===
In standard truth-functional propositional logic, ''association''&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;, or ''associativity''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley&lt;/ref&gt; are two [[validity|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to move parentheses in [[well-formed formula|logical expressions]] in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. The rules are: 
:&lt;math&gt;(P \or (Q \or R)) \Leftrightarrow ((P \or Q) \or R)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;(P \and (Q \and R)) \Leftrightarrow ((P \and Q) \and R),&lt;/math&gt;
where &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing &quot;can be replaced in a [[Formal proof|proof]] with.&quot;

=== Truth functional connectives ===

''Associativity'' is a property of some [[logical connective]]s of truth-functional [[propositional logic]]. The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

'''Associativity of disjunction''':
:&lt;math&gt;(P \or (Q \or R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \or Q) \or R)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((P \or Q) \or R) \leftrightarrow (P \or (Q \or R))&lt;/math&gt;
'''Associativity of conjunction''':
:&lt;math&gt;((P \and Q) \and R) \leftrightarrow (P \and (Q \and R))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P \and (Q \and R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \and Q) \and R)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Associativity of equivalence''':
:&lt;math&gt;((P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow R) \leftrightarrow (P \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow R))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow R)&lt;/math&gt;

== Non-associativity ==

A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''S'' that does not satisfy the associative law is called '''non-associative'''. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z\ne x*(y*z)\qquad\mbox{for some }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

For such an operation the order of evaluation ''does'' matter. For example:

* [[Subtraction]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(5-3)-2 \, \ne \, 5-(3-2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Division (mathematics)|Division]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(4/2)/2 \, \ne \, 4/(2/2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Exponentiation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
2^{(1^2)} \, \ne \, (2^1)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Also note that infinite sums are not generally associative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+\dots \, = \, 0
&lt;/math&gt;
whereas
:&lt;math&gt;
1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+\dots \, = \, 1
&lt;/math&gt;

The study of non-associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra. One area within non-associative algebra that has grown very large is that of [[Lie algebra]]s. There the associative law is replaced by the [[Jacobi identity]]. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics. They are an example of [[non-associative algebra]]s.

There are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth. They tend to come from some specific applications. Some of these arise in [[combinatorial mathematics]].  Other examples: [[Quasigroup]], [[Quasifield]], [[Nonassociative ring]].

=== Notation for non-associative operations ===
{{main|Operator associativity}}

In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the [[order of operations|order of evaluation]] if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression. However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.

A '''left-associative''' operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=(x*y)*z\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=((w*x)*y)*z\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
while a '''right-associative''' operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=x*(y*z)\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=w*(x*(y*z))\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur.  Left-associative operations include the following:

*Subtraction and division of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x-y-z=(x-y)-z\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R};&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x/y/z=(x/y)/z\qquad\qquad\quad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}\mbox{ with }y\ne0,z\ne0.&lt;/math&gt;

*Function application:
::&lt;math&gt;(f \, x \, y) = ((f \, x) \, y)&lt;/math&gt;
:This notation can be motivated by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Right-associative operations include the following:

*[[Exponentiation]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x^{y^z}=x^{(y^z)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

:The reason exponentiation is right-associative is that a repeated left-associative exponentiation operation would be less useful. Multiple appearances could (and would) be rewritten with multiplication:

::&lt;math&gt;(x^y)^z=x^{(yz)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Function (mathematics)|Function definition]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z} \rarr (\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto y \mapsto x - y = x \mapsto (y \mapsto x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

:Using right-associative notation for these operations can be motivated by the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] and by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.

*Taking the [[Cross product]] of three vectors:
::&lt;math&gt;\vec a \times (\vec b \times \vec c) \neq (\vec a \times \vec b ) \times \vec c \qquad \mbox{ for some } \vec a,\vec b,\vec c \in \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;

*Taking the pairwise [[average]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;{(x+y)/2+z\over2}\ne{x+(y+z)/2\over2} \qquad \mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \mbox{ with }x\ne z.&lt;/math&gt;
*Taking the [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of sets &lt;math&gt;(A\backslash B)\backslash C&lt;/math&gt; is not the same as &lt;math&gt;A\backslash (B\backslash C)&lt;/math&gt;. (Compare [[material nonimplication]] in logic.)

'''Absolute zero''' is the theoretical temperature at which [[entropy]] reaches its minimum value. The [[laws of thermodynamics]] state that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means.
A system at absolute zero still possesses [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[zero-point energy]], the energy of its ground state. The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. However, in the classical interpretation it is zero and the [[thermal energy]] of matter vanishes.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The zero point of any [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale, such as [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]], is set at absolute zero. By international agreement, absolute zero is defined as {{gaps|0|K}} on the Kelvin scale and as −273.15° on the Celsius scale.&lt;ref name=sib2115&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin)|work=SI Brochure, 8th edition|pages=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|date=13 March 2010 1967}} '''Note''': The triple point of water is 0.01 °C, not 0 °C; thus 0 K is −273.15 °C, not −273.16 °C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arora&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics|first1=C.

==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==
At temperatures near 0&amp;nbsp;K, nearly all molecular motion ceases and, when [[entropy]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S'', Δ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]]. Pure substances can (ideally) form perfect [[crystal]]s as ''T'' → 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] [[Nernst heat theorem|''heat theorem'']] makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as ''T'' → 0:
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{T \to 0} \Delta S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Third Law of Thermodynamics|Nernst postulate]] identifies the [[isotherm]] T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] the T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature.'' (≈&amp;nbsp;Callen, pp.&amp;nbsp;189–190)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An even stronger assertion is that ''It is impossible by any procedure to reduce the temperature of a system to zero in a finite number of operations.'' (≈&amp;nbsp;Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;157)

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] which have two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of &quot;chemical degeneracy&quot;. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous materials, simply get &quot;frozen in&quot; at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/sup&gt;. (Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&amp;nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.

Since the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,&lt;/math&gt;

thus, as ''T'' decreases, Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' approach each other (so long as Δ''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If Δ''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition Δ''G''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 may imply that Δ''H''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''Δ''S'' term is large enough.

Moreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This ensures that Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one which evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e. an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&amp;nbsp;186–187)

One model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermions]], have to be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that an electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The [[Fermi temperature]] is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.

==Relation with Bose–Einstein condensates==
{{Main|Bose–Einstein condensate}}

[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|250px|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. Left: just before the appearance of a Bose–Einstein condensate. Center: just after the appearance of the condensate. Right: after further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.]]
A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a [[state of matter]] of a dilute gas of weakly interacting [[boson]]s confined in an external [[potential]] and cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]] of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a [[macroscopic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=295–299|year=2001|title=Dynamics of collapsing and exploding Bose–Einstein condensates|pmid=11460153|issue=6844|doi=10.1038/35085500|arxiv = cond-mat/0105019 |bibcode = 2001Natur.412..295D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This state of matter was first predicted by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the [[quantum statistics]] of light quanta (now called [[photon]]s). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, &quot;Einstein: The Life and Times&quot; (Avon Books, 1971) pp. 408–9 ISBN 0-380-01159-X&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy years later, the first gaseous [[condensate]] was produced by [[Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]-[[JILA]] lab, using a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms cooled to 170 [[kelvin|nanokelvin]] (nK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = New State of Matter Seen Near Absolute Zero|url=http://physics.nist.gov/News/Update/950724.html|publisher=NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|1.7|e=-7|u=K}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Levi|first = Barbara Goss|title = Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman Share Nobel Prize for Bose–Einstein Condensates|work = Search &amp; Discovery|publisher = Physics Today online| year = 2001|url = http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html|accessdate =26 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024134547/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Absolute temperature scales==
Absolute, or [[thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic]], temperature is conventionally measured in [[kelvin]]s (Celsius-scaled increments) and in the [[Rankine scale]] ([[Fahrenheit]]-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the &quot;degree&quot;, so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.&lt;ref name=&quot;sib2115&quot;/&gt;

==Negative temperatures==
{{Main|Negative temperature}}

Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or [[Fahrenheit]] scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvin) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase&quot;/&gt; As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state, so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.

==History==
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero.]]
One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]]. His 1665 ''New Experiments and Observations touching Cold'', articulated the dispute known as the ''primum frigidum''. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four so-called &quot;elements&quot;), others within water, others air, and some more recently within [[niter|nitre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Primum+frigidum |title=Primum frigidum |work=Encyclopedia of Human Thermodynamics, Human Chemistry, and Human Physics |date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But all of them seemed to agree that, &quot;There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Robert|title=New Experiments and Observations touching Cold|year=1665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limit to the &quot;degree of cold&quot;===
The question whether there is a limit to the degree of cold possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the air [[thermometer]]. In his instrument, temperatures were indicated by the height at which a column of mercury was sustained by a certain mass of air, the volume, or &quot;spring&quot;, of which varied with the heat to which it was exposed. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air in it was reduced to nothing. On the scale he used, the boiling-point of water was marked at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51, so that the zero of his scale was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;sib2115&quot;/&gt; for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that −270&amp;nbsp;°C might be regarded as absolute cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing-point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. [[John Dalton]] in his ''Chemical Philosophy'' gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted −3000&amp;nbsp;°C as the natural zero of temperature.

===Lord Kelvin's work===
After [[James Prescott Joule]] had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature which was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based solely on the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]]. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Cold|title=Cold|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=Eleventh|year=1911 |publisher=The LoveToKnow Wiki|accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Very low temperatures==
[[File:Boomerang nebula.jpg|thumb|right|The rapid expansion of gases leaving the [[Boomerang Nebula]] causes the lowest observed temperature outside a laboratory.]]
The average temperature of the universe due to [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] today is 2.73 K.

Absolute zero cannot be achieved, although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of [[cryocoolers]], [[dilution refrigerator]]s, and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization. The use of [[laser cooling]] has produced temperatures less than a billionth of a kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmos Online – Verging on absolute zero|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/online/2176/verging-absolute-zero|date=200-09-04|author=Catchpole, Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties, including [[superconductor|superconductivity]], [[superfluid]]ity, and [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]]. To study such [[phenomenon|phenomena]], scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures.

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

An '''adiabatic process''' is any process occurring without input or output of [[heat]] within a system (i.e. during the process the system is thermodynamically isolated- there is no heat transfer with the surroundings). This is the opposite of a '''diabatic''' process, where there ''is'' heat transfer. A key concept in [[thermodynamics]], many rapid chemical and physical processes are described or approximated in this way.  Such processes are usually followed or preceded by events that do involve [[heat]] transfer (i.e. are non-adiabatic).  Examples include [[electron-transfer]]. 

Adiabatic processes can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time, so that there is no opportunity for significant heat exchange.&lt;ref&gt;http://buphy.bu.edu/~duffy/semester1/c27_process_adiabatic_sim.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the terms [[adiabatic]] and isocaloric can often be interchanged, adiabatic processes may be considered a subset of [[thermodynamic process|isocaloric process]]es; the remaining complement subset of isocaloric processes being processes where net heat transfer does not diverge regionally such as in an idealized case with mediums of infinite thermal conductivity or non-existent thermal capacity.

In an adiabatic irreversible process, dQ = 0 is not equal to TdS (TdS &gt; 0) where Q is thermal energy, T is temperature, and S is entropy.
dQ = TdS = 0 holds for reversible processes only.
For example, an '''adiabatic boundary''' is a boundary that is impermeable to heat transfer and the system is said to be adiabatically (or thermally) insulated; an insulated wall approximates an adiabatic boundary. Another example is the [[adiabatic flame temperature]], which is the temperature that would be achieved by a [[fire|flame]] in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings. An adiabatic process that is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] is also called an [[isentropic process]].  Conversely, an adiabatic process that is irreversible and extracts no work is in an [[isenthalpic]] process, such as viscous drag, progressing towards a nonnegative change in entropy.

One opposite extreme—allowing heat transfer with the surroundings, causing the temperature to remain constant—is known as an [[isothermal process]]. Since temperature is thermodynamically [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[entropy]], the isothermal process is conjugate to the adiabatic process for reversible transformations.

A transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered adiabatic when it is quick enough that no significant heat is transferred between the system and the outside. At the opposite extreme, a transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered isothermal if it is slow enough so that the system's temperature remains constant by heat exchange with the outside.

The term &quot;adiabatic&quot; literally means impassable,&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adiabatic&lt;/ref&gt; coming from the Greek roots ἀ- (&quot;not&quot;), διὰ- (&quot;through&quot;), and βαῖνειν (&quot;to pass&quot;); this etymology corresponds here to an absence of [[heat transfer]].
==Adiabatic heating and cooling==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Water]] --&gt;
Adiabatic changes in temperature occur due to changes in [[pressure]] of a [[gas]] while not adding or subtracting any [[heat]]. In contrast, [[free expansion]] is an [[isothermal]] process for an ideal gas.

'''Adiabatic heating''' occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g. a [[piston]].  [[Diesel engines]] rely on adiabatic heating during their compression stroke to elevate the temperature sufficiently to ignite the fuel.

Adiabatic heating also occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] when an [[air mass]] descends, for example, in a [[katabatic wind]] or [[Foehn wind|Foehn]] or [[chinook wind|chinook]] wind flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases, thus increasing the internal energy.

'''Adiabatic cooling''' occurs when the pressure of a substance is decreased as it does work on its surroundings. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] with [[orographic lifting]] and [[lee waves]], and this can form [[Pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or [[lenticular cloud]]s if the air is cooled below the [[dew point]]. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air decreases, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls and internal energy decreases. 

Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an [[expanding universe]] (to first order) can be described as an adiabatically cooling fluid. ''(See - [[Heat death of the universe]])''

Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as [[kimberlite]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kavanagh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=J.L.|coauthors=Sparks R.S.J.|year=2009|title=Temperature changes in ascending kimberlite magmas|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=286|issue=3&amp;ndash;4|pages=404&amp;ndash;413|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.011|url=http://monash.academia.edu/JanineKavanagh/Papers/114092/Temperature_changes_in_ascending_kimberlite_magma|accessdate=18 February 2012|bibcode = 2009E&amp;PSL.286..404K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such temperature changes can be quantified using the [[ideal gas law]], or the [[hydrostatic equation]] for atmospheric processes.

No process is truly adiabatic.  Many processes are close to adiabatic and can be easily approximated by using an adiabatic assumption, but there is always some heat loss; as no perfect insulators exist.

[[Image:Adiabatic.svg|thumb|341px|For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the [[internal energy]] of the working substance must decrease]]
The mathematical equation for an [[ideal gas]] undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is
: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} \qquad &lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is [[Specific volume|specific]] or [[molar volume]], and
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma = {C_{P} \over C_{V}} = \frac{f + 2}{f}, &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C_{P} &lt;/math&gt; being the [[specific heat]] for constant pressure,
&lt;math&gt; C_{V} &lt;/math&gt; being the specific heat for constant volume, &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], and &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas). 

For a monatomic ideal gas, &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 5/3 \,&lt;/math&gt;, and for a diatomic gas (such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 7/5 \,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/adiab.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the above formula is  only applicable to classical ideal gases and not [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein]] or [[Fermionic condensate|Fermi gases]].

For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that

: &lt;math&gt; P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma}= \operatorname{constant}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; VT^{f/2} = \operatorname{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is an absolute temperature.

This can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; TV^{\gamma - 1} = \operatorname{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

===Example of adiabatic compression===

Let's now look at a common example of adiabatic compression- the compression stroke in a [[gasoline engine]].  We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000cc's (one liter), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cc volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cc when the piston goes from bottom to top).  The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 degC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100,000 Pa, or about 14.7 PSI, or typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).

&lt;math&gt; P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 100,000 \operatorname{pa} * 1000^{7/5} = 100 \times 10^3 * 15.8 \times 10^3 = 1.58 \times 10^9 &lt;/math&gt;

so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.

The gas is now compressed to a 100cc volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).  The new volume is 100 ccs, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion:

&lt;math&gt; P * V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 1.58 \times 10^9 = P * 100^{7/5} &lt;/math&gt;

so solving for P:

&lt;math&gt; P = 1.58 \times 10^9 / {100^{7/5}} = 1.58 \times 10^9 / 630.9 =  2.50 \times 10^6 \operatorname{ Pa} &lt;/math&gt; 

or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.  Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.   

We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.
Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cc volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is:

&lt;math&gt; {P V \over T} = \operatorname {constant} = {{ 10^5 * 10^3 } \over {300} } = 3.33 \times 10^5 &lt;/math&gt;

We know the compressed gas has V = 100 cc and P = 2.50E6 pascals, so we can solve for temperature by simple algebra:

&lt;math&gt; {P V \over {\operatorname{constant}}} = T = {{2.50 \times 10^6 * 100} \over {3.33 \times 10^5}} = 751 &lt;/math&gt; 

That's a final temperature of 751 °K , or 477 °C, or 892 °F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.  This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause [[engine knocking]] when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a [[supercharger]] and [[intercooler]] to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.  A [[diesel engine]] operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of injected fuel.

===Adiabatic free expansion of a gas===
{{See also|Free expansion}}
For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.

===Derivation of continuous formula for adiabatic heating and cooling===
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then, according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]],

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad d U + \delta W = \delta Q = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''dU'' is the change in the internal energy of the system and ''δW'' is work done
''by'' the system.  Any work (''δW'') done must be done at the expense of internal energy ''U'', since no heat ''δQ'' is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure-volume work ''δW'' done ''by'' the system is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad \delta W = P \, dV. &lt;/math&gt;

However, ''P'' does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but
instead changes along with ''V''.

It is desired to know how the values of ''dP'' and
''dV'' relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.
For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad U = \alpha n R T, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] divided by two, ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]] and ''n'' is the number of moles in the system (a constant).

Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the [[ideal gas law]], &lt;math&gt;P V = n R T&lt;/math&gt;, yields

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad d U = \alpha n R \, dT
                  = \alpha \, d (P V)
                  = \alpha (P \, dV + V \, dP). &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (4) is often expressed as &lt;math&gt; d U = n C_{V} \, d T &lt;/math&gt;
because &lt;math&gt; C_{V} = \alpha R &lt;/math&gt;.

Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; -P \, dV = \alpha P \, dV + \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

simplify:

: &lt;math&gt; - (\alpha + 1) P \, dV = \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

and divide both sides by ''PV'':

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) {d V \over V} = \alpha {d P \over P}. &lt;/math&gt;

After integrating the left and right sides from &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; to V and from &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; to P and changing the sides respectively,

: &lt;math&gt; \ln \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
= {-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}} \ln \left( {V \over V_0} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiate both sides,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
=
\left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}},  &lt;/math&gt;

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
=
\left( {V_0 \over V} \right)^{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right) \left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P_0 V_0^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of discrete formula===

The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad \Delta U = \alpha R n_2T_2 - \alpha R n_1T_1 = \alpha R (n_2T_2 - n_1T_1) &lt;/math&gt;

At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P\, dV &lt;/math&gt;

Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad \Delta U + W = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

By the previous derivation,

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad P V^\gamma = \text{constant} = P_1 V_1^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging (4) gives

:&lt;math&gt; P = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into (2) gives

:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma\, dV &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating,

:&lt;math&gt; W = P_1 V_1^\gamma \frac{V_2^{1-\gamma}-V_1^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha P_1 V_1^{\gamma} \left( V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha P_1 V_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

By the continuous formula,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_2}{P_1}=\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{-\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

Or,

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-1 \over \gamma}=\frac{V_2}{V_1} &lt;/math&gt;
